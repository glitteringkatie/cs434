Sometimes her morning coffees way too strong And sometimes what she says, she says all wrong Right or wrong shes there beside me like only a friend would be And thats close enough to perfect for meNow shes been known to wear her pants too tight And drinking puts her out just like a light Heaven knows shes not an angel, but shed really like to be And thats close enough to perfect for meShe kisses me each morning and smiles her sleepy smile And she dont have to say it, I can see it in her eyes Dont you worry about my woman or what you think she ought to be Shes close enough to perfect for meSometimes she gets down and starts to cry But then again a lady has a right Shes everything I've ever wanted, she's all Ill ever need Shes close enough to perfect for meShe kisses me each morning and smiles her sleepy smile She dont have to say it, I can see it in her eyes Dont you worry about my woman or what you think she ought to be Shes close enough to perfect for me Woah oh, shes close enough to perfect for me
