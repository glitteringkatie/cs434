I saw you starin' at each other I saw your eyes begin to glow And I could tell you once were lovers You ain't hidin' nothing that I don't knowThere's an old flame burin' in your eyes That tears can't drown and make up can't disguise Now that old flame might not be stronger but it's been burnin' longer Than any spark I might have started in your eyesYou said it ended when he left you You say your love for me is strong But those old memories still upset you Well I might be a memory before too long'Cause there's an old flame burin' in your eyes That tears can't drown and make up can't disguise Now that old flame might not be stronger but it's been burnin' longer Than any spark I might have started in your eyesThere's an old flame burnin' in your eyes That tears can't drown and make up can't disguise Now that old flame might not be stronger but it's been burnin' longer Than any spark I might have started in your eyes
