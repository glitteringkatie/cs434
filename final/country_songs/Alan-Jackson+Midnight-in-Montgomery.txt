Midnight in Montgomery, silver eagle, lonely road I was on my way to Mobile for a big New Year's eve show I stopped for just a minute to see a friend outside of town Put my collar up, I found his name and felt the wind die downThen a drunk man in a cowboy hat took me by surprise Wearing shiny boots, a Nudi suit and haunting haunted eyes He said, "Friend it's good to see you, it's nice to know you care" Then the wind picked up, he was gone, was he ever really there?'Cause it's midnight in Montgomery, just hear that whippoorwill See the stars light up the purple sky, feel that lonesome chill 'Cause when the wind is right, you'll hear his songs, smell whiskey in the air Midnight in Montgomery, he's always singing thereWell I climbed back on that eagle, took one last look around Through red tail lights a shadow moved slow across the ground And off somewhere a midnight train is slowly passing by I could hear that whistle moaning, I'm so lonesome I could cry'Cause it's midnight in Montgomery, just hear that whippoorwill See the stars light up the purple sky, feel that lonesome chill 'Cause when the wind is right, you'll hear his songs, smell whiskey in the air Midnight in Montgomery, he's always singing there He's always singing there, Hank's always singing there
