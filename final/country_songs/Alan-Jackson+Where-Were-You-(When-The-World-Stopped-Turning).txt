Where were you when the world stopped turning That September day? Out in the yard With your wife and children Workin' on some stage in LA? Did you stand there in shock At the sight of that black smoke Rising against that blue sky? Did you shout out in anger And fear for your neighbor Or did you just sit down and cry?Did you weep for the children Who lost their dear loved ones Or pray for the ones who don't know? Did you rejoice for the people Who walked from the rubble And sob for the ones left below? Did you burst out in pride For the red, white, and blue And the heroes who died Just doing what they do? Did you look up to Heaven For some kind of answer And look at yourself And what really matters?I'm just a singer of simple songs I'm not a real political man I watch CNN but I'm not sure I could Tell you the difference in Iraq and Iran But I know Jesus and I talk to God And I remember this from when I was young Faith, hope and love are some good things He gave us And the greatest is loveWhere were you when the world stopped turning That September day? Teaching a class full of innocent children Driving down some cold interstate? Did you feel guilty Cause you're a survivor In a crowded room did you feel alone? Did you call up your mother and tell her you love her Did you dust off that Bible at home?Did you open your eyes, hope it never happened Or close your eyes and not go to sleep? Did you notice the sunset the first time in ages Or speak to some stranger on the street? Did you lay down at night and think of tomorrow Go out and buy you a gun? Did you turn off that violent old movie you're watching And turn on I Love Lucy reruns?Did you go to the church and hold hands with some stranger Stand in line and give your own blood? Did you just stay home and cling tight to your family Thank God you had somebody to love?I'm just a singer of simple songs I'm not a real political man I watch CNN but I'm not sure I could Tell you the difference in Iraq and Iran But I know Jesus and I talk to God And I remember this from when I was young Faith, hope and love are some good things He gave us And the greatest is loveI'm just a singer of simple songs I'm not a real political man I watch CNN but I'm not sure I could Tell you the difference in Iraq and Iran But I know Jesus and I talk to God And I remember this from when I was young Faith, hope and love are some good things He gave us And the greatest is loveWhere were you when the world stopped turning That September day
