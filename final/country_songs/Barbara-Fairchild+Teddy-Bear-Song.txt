I wish I had button eyes and a red felt nose Shaggy cotton skin and just one set of clothes Sittin' on a shelf in a local department store With no dreams to dream and nothin' to be sorry forI wish I was a teddy bear Not livin' or lovin' nor goin' nowhere I wish I was a teddy bear And I'm wishin' that I hadn't fallen in love with youI wish I had a wooden heart and a sawdust mind Then your memory wouldn't come around hurtin' all the time I'd have a sewed on smile and a painted twinkle in my eye And I never would have ever had to learn how to cryI wish I was a teddy bear Not livin' or lovin' nor goin' nowhere I wish I was a teddy bear And I'm wishin' that I hadn't fallen in love with youI wish I had a string you could pull to make me say Hi, I'm Teddy, ain't it a lovely day? Then I'd know every time I spoke the words were right And no would know the mess I made of my lifeI wish I was a teddy bear Not livin' or lovin' nor goin' nowhere I wish I was a teddy bear And I'm wishin' that I hadn't fallen in love with you And I'm wishin' that I hadn't fallen in love with you
