There's an old Kodak camera in my dresser drawer I ran across it just this afternoon And I realized that I don't ever use it anymore In fact last time I did I think it was with youWhen we were down in Cozumel, we had the whole beach to ourselves And it's crazy now to think that it's all there on that film And I could take it to the store to be developed, but what for I can still see everything just fine And who needs pictures with a memory like mineStandin' there I couldn't help but think about Everything that might be on that roll I think it even has another trip we took I guess that must've been at least three years agoWhen we were down in Baton Rouge and there wasn't much to do So we drove into New Orleans every afternoon And I swear that you would think that it was only yesterday 'Cause I can still see everything just fine Who needs pictures with a memory like mineSomewhere in my closet There's a cardboard box just sittin' on a shelf It's full of faded memories And it's been there ever since the night you leftOh, just forgotten photographs to remind me of the past Oh, but I can still see everything just fine Who needs pictures with a memory like mine Yeah, who needs pictures with a memory like mine
