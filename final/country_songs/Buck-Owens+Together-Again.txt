Together again my tears have stopped falling The long lonely nights are now at an end The key to my heart you hold in your hand And nothing else matters now we're together againTogether again the gray skies are gone You're back in my arms now, where you belong The love that I knew is living again And nothing else matters now we're together againAnd nothing else matters now we're together again
