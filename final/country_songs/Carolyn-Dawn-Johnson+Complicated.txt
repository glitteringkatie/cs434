I'm so scared that the way that I feel Is written all over my face When you walk into the room I wanna find a hiding placeWe used to laugh, we used to hug The way that old friends do But now a smile and a touch of your hand Just makes me come ungluedIt's such a contradiction Do I lie or tell the truth? Is it fact or fiction Oh, the way I feel for you?It's so complicated I'm so frustrated I wanna hold you close, I wanna push you away I wanna make you go, I wanna make you stayShould I say it Should I tell you how I feel? Oh, I want you to know but then again I don't It's so complicatedJust when I think I'm under control I think I finally got a grip Another friend tells me that My name is always on your lipsThey say I'm more than just a friend They say I must be blind Well, I admit that I've seen you watch me From the corner of your eyeOh, it's so confusing Yeah, I wish you'd just confess But think of what I'd be losing If your answer wasn't yesIt's so complicated I'm so frustrated I wanna hold you close, I wanna push you away I wanna make you go, I wanna make you stayShould I say it Should I tell you how I feel? Oh, I want you to know but then again I don't It's so complicatedI hate it 'cause I've waited So long for someone like youOh, should I say it Should I tell you how I feel? Oh, I want you to know but then again I don't It's so complicated, so complicated It's so complicated
