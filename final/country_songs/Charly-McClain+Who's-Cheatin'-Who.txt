Everywhere you look, you can write a book On the trouble with a woman and a man But you cannot impose, you can't stick your nose Into somethin' that you don't understandStill you wonder, who's cheatin' who And who's bein' true? Who don't even care anymore? It makes you wonder who's doin' right by someone tonight And whose car is parked next door?I thought I knew him well, I really couldn't tell That he had another lover on his mind You see, it felt so right when he held me tight How could I be so blind?But still you wonder, who's cheatin' who And who's bein' true? Who don't even care anymore? It makes you wonder who's doin' right by someone tonight And whose car is parked next door?A heart is on the line each and every time Love is stolen in the shadows of the night Though it's wrong all along, it keeps goin' on As long as they keep out of sightBut still you wonder, who's cheatin' who And who's bein' true? Who don't even care anymore? It makes you wonder who's doin' right by someone tonight And whose car is parked next door?Still you wonder, who's cheatin' who And who's bein' true? Who don't even care anymore? It makes you wonder who's doin' right by someone tonight And whose car is parked next door?But still you wonder, who's cheatin' who And who's bein' true? Who don't even care anymore? It makes you wonder who's doin' right by someone tonight And whose car is parked next door?
