For all I'd been blessed with in this life There was an emptiness in me I was imprisoned by the power of gold With one honest touch you set me freeLet the world stop turnin' Let the sun stop burnin' Let them tell me Love's not worth goin' throughIf it all falls apart I will know deep in my heart The only dream that mattered Had come true In this life I was loved by youFor every mountain I have climbed Every raging river crossed You were the treasure that I longed to find Without your love I would be lostLet the world stop turnin' Let the sun stop burnin' Let them tell me Love's not worth going throughIf it all falls apart I will know deep in my heart The only dream that mattered Had come true In this life I was loved by you In this life I was loved by you
