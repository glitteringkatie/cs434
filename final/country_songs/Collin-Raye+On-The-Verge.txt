Well, they shouldn't Have played that good I got carried away And let the music go to my headWell, she shouldn't Have worn that dress The way it curled around When she was spinning Just killed me deadMy heart began to tell My body and my soul That it had gotten in the mood To lose controlOh no, when did neon light Turn into moon glow When did that jukebox Turn to a rainbowI'm about to give Into this urge One more slow dance With her arms around meOne more long glance And nothing will slow down me I got no chance If I'm not in love I'm on the vergeAll I wanted to be was cool It ain't my style to overheat Much less burnBut as we floated Across the floor All at once I flashed Right past the point, of no returnAnd when we said goodnight The sun was on the rise And any stars that hadn't set Had fallen in my eyesOh no, when did neon light Turn into moon glow When did that jukebox Turn to a rainbowI'm about to give Ito this urge One more slow dance With her arms around meOne more long glance And nothing will slow down me I got no chance If I'm not in love I'm on the vergeOne more slow dance With her arms around me One more long glance And nothing will slow down me I got no chance If I'm not in love I'm on the verge If I'm not in love I'm on the verge
