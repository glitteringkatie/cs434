There's a lot of ways of sayin' What I wanna say to you There's songs and poems and promises And dreams that might come trueBut I won't talk of starry skies Or moonlight on the ground I'll come right out and tell you I'd just love to lay you downLay you down and softly whisper Pretty love words in your ear Lay you down and tell you all the things A woman loves to hear I'll let you know how much it means Just havin' you around Oh, darlin', how I'd love to lay you downThere's so many ways your sweet love's Made this house into a home You've got a way of doing Little things that turn me onLike standin' in the kitchen In your faded cotton gown With your hair all up in curlers I still love to lay you downLay you down and softly whisper Pretty love words in your ear Lay you down and tell you all the things A woman loves to hear I'll let you know how much it means Just havin' you around Oh, darlin', how I'd love to lay you downWhen a whole lot of Decembers Are showin' in your face Your auburn hair has faded And silver takes it's placeYou'll be just as lovely And I'll still be around And if I can't I know that I'd still love to lay you downLay you down and softly whisper Pretty love words in your ear Lay you down and tell you all the things A woman loves to hear I'll let you know how much it means Just havin' you around Oh, darlin', how I'd love to lay you downLay you down and softly whisper Pretty love words in your ear Lay you down and tell you all the things My woman loves to hear I'll let you know how much it means Just havin' you around Oh, darlin', how I love to lay you downLay you down and softly whisper Pretty love words in your ear Lay you down and tell you all the things My woman loves to hear I'll let you know how much it means Just havin' you around
