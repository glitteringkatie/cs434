She tried to hide it by the faded denim clothes she wore But I knew she'd never been inside a bar before And I felt like a peasant who just had met a queen And she knew I saw right through those tight fittin' jeansI asked her, "What's a woman like you, doin' here? I see you're used to champagne but I'll buy you a beer" She said, "You've got me figured out but I'm not what I seem And for a dance I'll tell you 'bout these tight fittin' jeans"She said, "I married money, I'm used to wearin' pearls But I've always dreamed of bein' just a good old boy's girl So tonight I left those crystal candle lights to live a dream And pardner, there's a tiger in these tight fittin' jeans"We danced every dance and, Lord, the beer that we went through I'm satisfied I did my best to make her dream come true As she played out her fantasy before my eyes it seemed A cowgirl came alive inside those tight fittin' jeansIn my mind she's still a lady, that's all I'm gonna say I knew that I'd been broken by the time we parted ways And I know I held more woman than most eyes have ever seen That night I knew a lady wearin' tight fittin' jeansWell now she's back in her world and I'm still stuck in mine But I know she'll always remember the time A cowboy once had a millionaire's dream And Lord, I loved that lady wearin' tight fittin' jeans
