I can almost hear the stillness As it yields to the sound of your heart beating And I can almost hear the echo Of the thoughts that I know you must be thinkingAnd I can feel your body tremble As you wonder what this moment holds in store And as I put my arms around you I can tell you've never been this far beforeI don't know what I'm saying As my trembling fingers touch forbidden places I only know I've waited For so long for the chance that we are takingI don't know and I don't care What made you tell him you don't love him anymore And as I taste your tender kisses I can tell you've never been this far beforeAnd as I take the love you're giving I can feel the tension building in your mind And you're wondering if tomorrow I'll still love you like I'm loving you tonightYou have no way of knowing But tonight will only make me love you more And I hope that you'll believe me 'Cause I know you've never been this far before
