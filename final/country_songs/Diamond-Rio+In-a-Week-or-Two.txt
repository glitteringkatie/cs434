In a week or two I would have been ready I would have known what to say But I missed my chance When the words, "I love you" Came just a little too lateIn a week or two I was gonna bring you diamonds In a week or two A long, long string of pearls and We would've run down to the river at night Sailed away, just me and you In a week or twoA little more time Was all I needed But somehow fall became spring But put off today You can do tomorrow Sometimes you don't do a thingIn a week or two I was gonna bring you diamonds In a week or two A long, long string of pearls and We would've run down to the river at night Sailed away, just me and you In a week or twoThese words in my heart Never had a chance to be heard But I'm telling you now For all that it's worthIn a week or two I was gonna bring you diamonds In a week or two A long, long string of pearls and We would've run down to the river at night Sailed away, just me and you In a week or two
