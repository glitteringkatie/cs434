I can't stop loving you I've made up my mind To live in memories Of old lonesome timesI can't stop wanting you It's useless to say So I'll just live my life In dreams of yesterdayThose happy hours That we once knew Though long ago Still make me blueThey say the time Heals the broken heart But time is stood still Since we've been apartI can't stop loving you I've made up my mind To live in memories Of old lonesome timesI can't stop wanting you It's useless to say So I'll just live my life In dreams of yesterday
