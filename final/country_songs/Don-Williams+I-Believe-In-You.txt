I don't believe in superstars Organic food and foreign cars I don't believe the price of gold The certainty of growing oldThat right is right and left is wrong That north and south can't get along That east is east and west is west And being first is always bestBut I believe in love I believe in babies I believe in Mom and Dad And I believe in youWell, I don't believe that heaven waits For only those who congregate I like to think of God as love He's down below, he's up aboveHe's watching people everywhere He knows who does and doesn't care And I'm an ordinary man Sometimes I wonder who I amBut I believe in love I believe in music I believe in magic And I believe in youI know with all my certainty What's goin' on with you and me Is a good thing It's true, I believe in youI don't believe virginity Is as common as it used to be In working days and sleeping nights That black is black and white is whiteThat Superman and Robin Hood Are still alive in Hollywood That gasoline's in short supply The rising cost of getting byBut I believe in love I believe in old folks I believe in children I believe in youI believe in love I believe in babies I believe in Mom and Dad And I believe in you
