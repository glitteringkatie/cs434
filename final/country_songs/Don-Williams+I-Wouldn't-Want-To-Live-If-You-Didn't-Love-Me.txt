Sometimes you may think I take you for granted And granted, sometimes maybe I do 'Cause, I've grown so used to you Lyin' next to me That I wouldn't want to live If you didn't love meNo, I wouldn't want to get up In the mornin' if you weren't there To kiss me and start my day, off right And to be waiting, when I get home With lovin' just for me No, I wouldn't want to live If you didn't love meIt's love that makes the world go 'round And my love for you just grows with leaps and bounds 'Cause, you know just what to do When the world has turned all blue And I wouldn't want to live if you didn't love meNo, I wouldn't want to get up In the mornin' if you weren't there To kiss me and start my day, off right And to be waiting, when I get home With lovin' just for me No, I wouldn't want to live If you didn't love me
