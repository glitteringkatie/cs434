It was six in the morning when I made the county line There's someone I've got to talk to, can't get it off my mind He is just a kid and he's in a pretty rough spot Two dimes to make a phone call, that's about all I gotHow's my boy today? I know it's been three weeks But you know how far I've got to go these days to make ends meet How's your mama now, with her new live in friend? Oh, how I hate the wounds that never seem to mendYou said, I don't call him daddy, but he takes care of things When you pick me up on Friday, are you gonna bring me anything? Oh, don't worry Dad, you know, it don't matter what we do 'Cause I don't call him daddy, he can never be like youGod bless the little hearts, there the ones who really pay When Mom and Dad can't get along and they go their separate ways In a way I'm glad there's someone there to fill the empty space Tears of understanding stream down a dirty faceYou said, I don't call him daddy, but he takes care of things When you pick me up on Friday, are you gonna bring me anything? Oh, don't worry Dad, you know, it don't matter what we do 'Cause I don't call him daddy, he can never be like you Be like you, be like youHe is quite a little man growin' up as fast as he can And I don't get to see him half as much as I had planned There's so much I need to tell him, so precious little time A little rain on the window, and a little wave goodbyeYou said, I don't call him daddy, but he takes care of things When you pick me up on Friday, are you gonna bring me anything? Oh, don't worry Dad, you know, it don't matter what we do 'Cause I don't call him daddy, he can never be like youHe said, I don't call him daddy, but he takes care of things When you pick me up on Friday, are you gonna bring me anything? Oh, don't worry Dad, you know, it don't matter what we do 'Cause I don't call him daddy, he can never be like you
