I've always been the kind of man Who doesn't believe in strings Long term obligations are just unnecessary things But girl, ya got me thinkin While I'm drinkin one more beer If I'm headed for a heartache Then why the hell am I still hereI'm testin my resistance And it's wearin mighty thin I've got the feelin I should leave Before the roof caves in My mind tells me to move along But my body begs me stay And now I feel the need to hold you close And love the night away While you're turnin meChorus: Every which way but loose You turn me Every which way but loose Inside the fire's burnin me In my mind you just keep turnin me Every which but loose Baby there's no excuse To turn me every which way but looseWhen the sun comes up in the mornin It should find me some place new But right this minute all I want Is to lay here next to you Those memories still keep callin me From somewhere in my past Better hurry if they want me 'Cause I can feel me fadin fast While you're turnin meRepeat Chorus
