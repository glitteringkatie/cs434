Seven lonely days And a dozen towns ago I reached out one night And you were gone Don't know why you'd run, What you're running to or from All I know is I want to bring you homeSo I'm walking in the rain, Thumbing for a ride On this lonely Kentucky back road I've loved you much too long And my love's too strong To let you go, never knowing What went wrong Kentucky rain keeps pouring down And up ahead's another town That I'll go walking throughWith the rain in my shoes, Searchin' for you In the cold Kentucky rain, In the cold Kentucky rain Showed your photograph To some old gray bearded manSitting on a bench Outside a gen'ral store They said "Yes, she's been here" But their memory wasn't clearWas it yesterday, No, wait the day before So I fin'ly got a ride With a preacher man who asked "Where you bound on such a cold dark afternoon?"As we drove on through the rain As he listened I explained And he left me with a prayer That I'd find you
