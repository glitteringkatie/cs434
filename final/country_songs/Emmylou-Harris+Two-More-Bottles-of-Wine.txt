We came out west together with a common desire The fever we had migtha set the West Coast on fire Two months later got trouble in mind Oh my baby moved out and left me behindBut it's all right 'cause it's midnight And I got two more bottles of wineThe way he left sure turned my head around Seemed like overnight it just up and put me down Well I ain't gonna let it bother me today I've been workin' and I'm too tired anywayBut it's all right, midnight And I got two more bottles of wineWell I'm sixteen hundred miles from the people I know Have been doin' all I can but opportunity sure come slow Well I'd be in the sun all day But I'm sweepin' out a warehouse in West L.A.But it's all right 'cause it's midnight And I got two more bottles of wineI'm sixteen hundred miles from the people I know Been doin' all I can but opportunity sure come slow Lord, I'd be in the sun all day But I'm sweepin' out a warehouse in West L.A.But it's all right 'cause it's midnight And I got two more bottles of wine Yes, it's all right 'cause it's midnight And I got two more bottles of wine Yes, it's all right 'cause it's midnight And I got two more bottles of wine
