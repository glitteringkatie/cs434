You left me and you went away You said that you'd be back in just a day You've broken your promise and you've left me here alone I don't know why you did dear but I do know that you're goneI'm walking the floor over you I can't sleep a wink that is true I'm hoping and I'm praying as my heart breaks right in two Walking the floor over youNow darling, you know I love you well Love you more than I can ever tell I thought that you wanted me and always would be mine But you went and left me here with troubles on my mindI'm walking the floor over you I can't sleep a wink that is true I'm hoping and I'm praying as my heart breaks right in two Walking the floor over youNow someday you may be lonesome to Walking the floor is good for you Just keep right on walking and it won't hurt you to cry Remember that I love you and I will the day I dieI'm walking the floor over you I can't sleep a wink that is true I'm hoping and I'm praying as my heart breaks right in two Walking the floor over you
