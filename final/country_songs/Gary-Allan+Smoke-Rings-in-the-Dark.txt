Well I won't make you tell me What I've come to understand You're a certain kind of woman I'm a different kind of manI've tried to make you love me You've tried to find a spark Of the flame that burned But somehow turned to smoke rings in the darkThe loneliness within me Takes a heavy toll 'Cause it burns as slow as whiskey Through an empty aching soulAnd the night is like a dagger Long and cold and sharp As I sit here on the front steps Blowing smoke rings in the darkI know I must be going 'Cause love's already gone And all I'm taking with me Are the pieces of my heart And all I'll leave are smoke rings in the darkThe rain falls where it wants to Wind blows where it will Everything on earth goes somewhere But I swear we're standin' stillSo, I'm not going to wake you I'll go easy on your heart I'll just touch your face and drift away Like smoke rings in the darkI know I must be going 'Cause loves already gone And all I'm taking with me Are the pieces of my heart And all I'll leave are smoke rings in the dark
