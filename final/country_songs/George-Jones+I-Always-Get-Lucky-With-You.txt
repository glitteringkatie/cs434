I've had good luck, and bad luck And no luck, it's true But I always get lucky with youI've been turned on, and turned down When the bars close at two But I always get lucky with youI've keep two strikes against me Most all of the time And when it's down to just a phone call I'm minus a dimeThere's been good days, and bad days But when the day is through I always get lucky with youI've keep two strikes against me Most all of the time And when it's down to just a phone call I'm minus a dimeThere's been good days, and bad days But when the day is through I always get lucky with you I always get lucky with you
