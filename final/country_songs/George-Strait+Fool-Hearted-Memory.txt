Nickels and dimes, memories and wine She's on his mind once again The same ol' stew, the same ol' fool Played by the rules but didn't win There's an old love in his heart that he can't lose He tried forgettin' but he knows that it's no useHe's got a fool hearted memory It won't let him see, that she walked out the door He's got a fool hearted memory, he sits patiently Here every night so it can fool him moreShe was his girl, his only world That string of pearls that slipped away A thousand dimes, a thousand times He doesn't mind what they say He fills the jukebox, then plays the same ol' song He fills his glass and then he turns her memory onBut it's a fool hearted memory It won't let him see, that she walked out the door He's got a fool hearted memory, he sits patiently Here every night so it can fool him more
