I've been walkin' these streets so long Singin' the same old song I know every crack in these dirty sidewalks of BroadwayWhere hustle's the name of the game And nice guys get washed away Like the snow and the rainThere's been a load of compromisin' On the road to my horizon But I'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on meLike a rhinestone cowboy Riding out on a horse in a star spangled rodeoLike a rhinestone cowboy Getting cards and letters from people I don't even know And offers comin' over the phoneWell, I really don't mind the rain And a smile can hide all the pain But you're down when you're ridin' the train that's takin' the long wayAnd I dream of the things I'll do With a subway token And a dollar tucked inside my shoeThere'll be a load of compromisin' On the road to my horizon But I'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on meLike a rhinestone cowboy Riding out on a horse in a star spangled rodeoRhinestone cowboy Gettin' cards and letters from people I don't even know And offers comin' over the phoneLike a rhinestone cowboy Riding out on a horse in a star spangled rodeoLike a rhinestone cowboy Gettin' card and letters from people I don't even know
