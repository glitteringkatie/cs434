Somewhere there should be for all The world to see a statue of a fool made of stone An image of a man who let love slip through his handsAnd then just let him stand there all alone And there on his face a gold tear should be placed To honor the million tears he's criedAnd the hurt in his eyes would show so everyone would know Concealed is a broken heart inside So build a statue and oh build it high so that all can see Then inscribe the world's greatest fool and name it after me
