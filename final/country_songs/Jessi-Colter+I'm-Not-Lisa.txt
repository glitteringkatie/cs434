I'm not Lisa, my name is Julie Lisa left you years ago My eyes are not blue, but mine won't leave you Till the sunlight has touched your faceShe was your morning light Her smile told of no night Your love for her grew With each rising sunAnd then one winter day, his hand led her away She left you here drowning in your tears Here, where you've stayed for years Crying, Lisa, LisaI'm not Lisa, my name is Julie Lisa left you years ago My eyes are not blue, but mine won't leave you Till the sunlight has touched your face, I'm not Lisa
