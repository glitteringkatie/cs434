I could tell he'd had a tough life By the way he sat and stared And me, I'd come to push and shove So I pulled up a chairWe talked of roads untraveled We talked of love untrue Of strings that come unraveled We were kings and kindred foolsAnd just when I'd hit bottom That old man raised his glass And said at least we had our chances There's those who never haveSo here's to all the soldiers Who have ever died in vain The insane locked up in themselves The homeless down on MainTo those who stand on empty shores And spit against the wind And those who wait forever For ships that don't come inHe said it's only life's illusions That bring us to this bar To pick up these old crutches And compare each other's scars'Cause the things we're calling heartache Hell, they're hardly worth our time We bitch about a dollar When there's those without a dimeAnd as he ordered one last round He said I guess we can't complain God made life a gamble And we're still in the gameSo here's to all the soldiers Who have ever died in vain The insane locked up in themselves The homeless down on MainTo those who stand on empty shores And spit against the wind And those who wait forever For ships that don't come inAnd those who wait forever For ships that don't come in
