If you really wanna know, she comes here a lot She just loves to hear the music and dance K13 is her favorite song If you play it you might have a chanceTonight she's only sippin' white wine She's friendly and fun lovin' most of the timeBut don't ask her on a straight Tequila night She'll start thinkin' about him and she's ready to fight Blames her broken heart on every man in sight On a straight Tequila nightHere's a glass of Chablis, some quarters and change Maybe you can turn her love life around Then she won't need the salt or the lime anymore To shoot that ol' memory downJust remember her heart's on the mend If you ever come back to see her againDon't ask her on a straight Tequila night She'll start thinkin' about him and she's ready to fight Blames her broken heart on every man in sight On a straight Tequila nightDon't ask her on a straight Tequila night She'll start thinkin' about him and she's ready to fight Blames her broken heart on every man in sight On a straight Tequila nightDon't ask her on a straight Tequila night She'll start thinkin' about him and she's ready to fight Blames her broken heart on every man in sight On a straight Tequila night
