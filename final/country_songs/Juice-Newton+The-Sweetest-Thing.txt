When I see you in the morning That old sleep still in your eyes I remember all the laughter And the tears we shared last nightAnd as we lie here, just two shadows In the light before the dawn The sweetest thing I've ever known Is loving youAnd I have never been afraid of losing And I have never wanted love to be a chain I only know that when I'm with you You're my sunshine, you're my rain The sweetest thing I've ever known Is loving youNow, you and I, we're not children We have both been loved before We have given and we have taken Many rides on troubled shoresAnd all the heartaches and temptations Only make me love you more The sweetest thing I've ever known Is loving youAnd I have never been afraid of losing And I have never wanted love to be a chain I only know that when I'm with you You're my sunshine, you're my rain The sweetest thing I've ever known Is loving youThe sweetest thing I've ever known Is loving you
