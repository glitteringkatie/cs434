You've painted up your lips and rolled and curled your tinted hair Ruby are you contemplating, going out somewhere The shadow on the wall, tells me the sun is going down Oh Ruby, don't take your love to townIt wasn't me that started that ol' crazy Asian war But I was proud to go and do my patriotic chore And yes it's true, that I'm not the man I used to be But Ruby, I still need some companyIt's hard to love a man, whose legs are bent and paralyzed And the wants and needs of a woman of your age Ruby I realize It won't be long, I've heard them say, until I'm not around, Oh Ruby, don't take your love to townShe's leaving now 'cause I just heard the slamming of the door The way I know I've heard it slam 100 times before And if I could move I'd get my gun and put her in the ground, oh Ruby Don't take your love to town, oh Ruby, for God's sake turn around
