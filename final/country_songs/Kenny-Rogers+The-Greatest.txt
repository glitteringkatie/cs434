Little boy, in a baseball hat stands in the field with his ball and bat. Says, "I am the greatest player of them all" puts his bat on his shoulder and he tosses up his ball. And the ball goes up and the ball comes down swings his bat all the way around The world so still you can hear the sound, the baseball falls to the ground. Now the little boy doesn't say a word, picks up his ball, he is undeterred. Says, "I am the greatest there has ever been" and he grits his teeth and he tries it again. And the ball goes up and the ball comes down swings his bat all the way around The world so still you can hear the sound, the baseball falls to the ground. He makes no excuses, he shows no fear, he just closes his eyes and listens to the cheers. Little boy, he adjusts his hat, picks up his ball, stares at his bat Says,"I am the greatest, the game is on the line" and he gives his all one last time. And the ball goes up and the moon so bright, swings his bat with all his might The world's as still, as still can be, the baseball falls and that's strike three. Now it's suppertime and his momma calls, little boy starts home with his bat and ball. Says, "I am the greatest, that is a fact, but even I didn't know I could pitch like that!" Says, "I am the greatest,that is understood, but even I didn't know I could pitch that good!"
