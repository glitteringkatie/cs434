Blue Oh, so lonesome for you Why can't you be blue over meBlue Oh, so lonesome for you Tears fill my eyes till I can't seeThree o'clock in the morning Here am I Sittin' here so lonely So lonesome I could cryBlue Oh, so lonesome for you Why can't you be blue over meNow that it's over I realized Those weak words you whispered were nothin' but liesBlue oh, so lonesome for you Why can't you be blue over me Why can't you be blue over me
