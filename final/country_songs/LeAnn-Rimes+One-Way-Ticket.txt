Standing on the border Looking out into the great unknown I can feel my heart beating faster as I step out on my own There's a new horizon and the promise of a favorable wind I'm heading out tonight, traveling light I'm gonna start all over againAnd buy a one way ticket on a west bound train See how far I can go I'm gonna go out dancing in the pouring rain And talk to someone I don't know I will face the world around me Knowing that I'm strong enough to let you go And I will fall in love again Because I canGonna climb the mountain And look the eagle in the eye I won't let fear clip my wings and tell me how high I can fly How could I have ever believed That love had to be so blind When freedom was waiting, down at the station All I had to do was make up my mindAnd buy a one way ticket on a west bound train See how far I can go I'm gonna go out dancing in the pouring rain And talk to someone I don't know I will face the world around me Knowing that I'm strong enough to let you go And I will fall in love again Because I canWell, I have walked through the fire And crawled on my knees through the valley of the shadow of doubt Then the truth came shining like a light on me and now I can see my way outI'm gonna buy a one way ticket on a west bound train See how far I can go I'm gonna go out dancing in the pouring rain And talk to someone I don't knowI'm gonna buy a one way ticket on a west bound train Gonna have my breakfast with some pink champagne Gonna sail the ocean, gonna spread my wings Gonna climb that mountain, gonna do everything.
