Never again, again once more I'll let you back in I know how the story ends but I can't help myself You'll break my heart I know through my tears I'll watch you go Then just like it's always been I'll say "Never again, again"Each time you leave I say "I've had enough" But I must be addicted to your kind of love I swear to myself I'm gonna stand my ground But one look at you breaks my defenses downAnd here comes never again, again once more I'll let you back in I know how the the story ends but I can't help myself You'll break my heart I know through my tears I'll watch you go Then just like its always been I'll say "Never again, again"I swear to my self I'm gonna stand my ground But one look at you breaks my defenses down And here comes never again, again once more I let you back in And just like its always been I'll say "Never again, again" And just like it's always been I'll say "Never again, again"
