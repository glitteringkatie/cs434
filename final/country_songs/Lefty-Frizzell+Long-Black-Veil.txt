Ten years ago, on a cold dark night There was someone killed 'neath the town hall light There were few at the scene, but they all agreed That the slayer who ran looked a lot like meThe judge said, "Son what is your alibi? If you were somewhere else then you won't have to die" I spoke not a word though it meant my life For I had been in the arms of my best friend's wifeShe walks these hills in a long black veil She visits my grave when the night winds wail Nobody knows, nobody sees Nobody knows but meThe scaffold is high, and eternity nears She stood in the crowd and shed not a tear But sometimes at night when the cold wind mourns In a long black veil she cries over my bonesShe walks these hills in a long black veil She visits my grave when the night winds wail Nobody knows, nobody sees Nobody knows but me, nobody knows but me, nobody knows but me
