The sign in the window said, "For sale or trade" On the last remaining dinosaur Detroit made Seven hundred dollars was a heck of a deal For a four hundred horsepower jukebox on wheelsAnd that road rolls out like a welcome mat I don't know where it goes but it beats where we're at We always said, "Someday, somehow We were gonna get away, gonna blow this town"What about now, how 'bout tonight? Baby for once let's don't think twice Let's take that spin that never ends That we've been talking aboutWhat about now, why should we wait? We can chase these dreams down the Interstate And be long gone 'fore the world moves on And makes another round, what about now?We've been puttin' this off baby long enough Just give me the word and we'll be kickin' up dust We both know it's just a matter of time 'Til our hearts start racin' for that county lineWhat about now, how 'bout tonight? Baby for once let's don't think twice Let's take that spin that never ends That we've been talking aboutWhat about now, why should we wait? We can chase these dreams down the Interstate And be long gone 'fore the world moves on And makes another round, what about now?We could hang around this town Forever making plans But there won't ever be a better time To take this chanceWhat about now, how 'bout tonight? Baby for once let's don't think twice Let's take that spin that never ends That we've been talking aboutWhat about now, why should we wait? We can chase these dreams down the Interstate And be long gone 'fore the world moves on And makes another round, what about now? YeahWhat about now?
