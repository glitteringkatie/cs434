I'm looking for something in red Something that's shocking to turn someone's head Strapless and sequined and cut down to there Stockings and garters and lace underwear The guaranteed number to knock a man dead I'm looking for something in redI'm looking for something in green Something to out do an ex high school queen Jealousy comes in the color of jade Do you have some pumps and a purse in this shade And a perfume that whispers, "Please come back to me"? I'm looking for something in greenI'm looking for something in white Something that shimmers in soft candle light Everyone calls us the most perfect pair Should I wear a veil or a rose in my hair? Well, the train must be long and the waist must be tight I'm looking for something in whiteI'm looking for something in blue Something real tiny, the baby's brand new He has his father's nose and his chin We once were hot lovers now we're more like friends Don't tell me that's just what old married folk do I'm looking for something in blueI'm looking for something in red Like the one that I wore when I first turned his head Strapless and sequined and cut down to there Just a size larger than I wore last year The guaranteed number to knock a man dead I'm looking for something, I've gotta have something I'm looking for something in red
