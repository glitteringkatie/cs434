I realize the way your eyes deceived me With tender looks that I mistook for love; So take away the flowers that you gave me And send the kind that you remind me of.Your pretty lips look warm and so appealingThey seem to have the sweetness of a rose; But when you give a kiss there is no feelingIt's just a stiff and artificial pose.I thought that you would be a perfect loverYou seemed so full of sweetness at the start; But like a big red rose that's made of paperThere isn't any sweetness in your heart.Paper Roses paper RosesOh how real those roses seem to be! But they're only imitation Like your imitation lover for me.
