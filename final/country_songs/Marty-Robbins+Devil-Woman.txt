I told Mary about us, told her about our great sin Mary cried and forgave me and Mary took me back again Said if I wanted my freedom, I could be free evermore But I don't want to be and I don't want to see Mary cry anymoreOh, devil woman, devil woman, let go of me Devil woman, let me be And leave me alone I want to go homeMary is waitin' and weepin' down in our shack by the sea Even after I've hurt her, Mary' still in love with me Devil woman, it's over, trapped no more by your charms 'Cause I don't want to stay, I want to get away, women let go of my armsOh, devil woman, devil woman, let go of me Devil woman, let me be And leave me alone I want to go homeDevil woman, you're evil like the dark coral reef Like the winds that bring high tides, you bring sorrow and grief You made me ashamed to face Mary, barely had the strength to tell Skies are not so black, Mary took me back, Mary has broken your spellOh, devil woman, devil woman, let go of me Devil woman, let me be And leave me alone I want to go homeRunnin' along by the seashore, runnin' as fast as I can. Even the seagulls are happy, glad I'm coming home again Never again will I ever 'cause another tear to fall Down the beach I see what belongs to me, the one I want most of allOh, devil woman, devil woman, don't follow me Devil woman, let me be And leave me alone I'm going back home
