We don't smoke marijuana in Muskogee We don't take our trips on LSD We don't burn our draft cards down on Main Street We like livin' right, and bein' freeWe don't make a party out of lovin' We like holdin' hands and pitchin' woo We don't let our hair grow long and shaggy Like the hippies out in San Francisco doI'm proud to be an Okie from Muskogee, A place where even squares can have a ball We still wave Old Glory down at the courthouse, And white lightnin's still the biggest thrill of allLeather boots are still in style for manly footwear Beads and Roman sandals won't be seen Football's still the roughest thing on campus And the kids here still respect the college deanWAnd I'm proud to be an Okie from Muskogee A place where even squares can have a ball. We still wave Old Glory down at the courthouse And white lightnin's still the biggest thrill of allAnd white lightnin's still the biggest thrill of all In Muskogee, Oklahoma, USA.
