It's a big job gettin' by with nine kids and a wife You know I've been a workin' man dang near all my life I'll keep on working long as my two hands are fit to use I drink my beer at a tavern and sing a little bit of these working man bluesWell, I keep my nose on the grindstone, work hard every day Get tired on the weekend, after I draw my pay But I go back workin', come Monday mornin', I'm right back with the crew I drink a little beer that evening, sing a little bit of these working man bluesSometimes I think about leavin', do a little bummin' around Throw my bills out the window, catch me a train to another town But I go back workin', I got to buy my kids a brand new pair of shoes I drink my beer at a tavern and cry a little bit of these workin' man blues Here comin', workin' manWell, hey, hey, the working man, the working man like me Never been on welfare and that's one place he will not be He'd be workin' just as long as his two hands are fit to use Might drink a little beer at a tavern sing a little bit of them workin' man blues This song for the working man
