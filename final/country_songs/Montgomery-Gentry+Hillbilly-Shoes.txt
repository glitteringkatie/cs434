I was there when the men came and told us all the news Father forgive them for they know not what they do Till they walk a while, a country mile In my hillbilly shoesYou want to judge me by the whiskey on my breath You think you know me but you ain't seen nothing yet Till you walk a while, a country mile In my hillbilly shoes, in my hillbilly shoesYou work all day in the muck and the mire Dance a little jig and a stomp by the fire Ain't too much these boots can't do Might even kick a little sense into youWell, I'm going up cripple creek, going in a run Going up cripple creek to have a little fun Law man said they found some tracks People saw them leavin' but they never come backOh, you don't know me, you don't know You don't know, you don't know Till you walk a while, a country mile In my hillbilly shoes, in my hillbilly shoes
