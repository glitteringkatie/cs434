I remember it all very well lookin' back It was the summer I turned eighteen We lived in a one room, rundown shack On the outskirts of New Orleans We didn't have money for food or rent To say the least we were hard pressed Then Mama spent every last penny we had To buy me a dancin' dressMama washed and combed and curled my hair And she painted my eyes and lips then I stepped into a satin Dancin' dress that had a split on the side clean up to my hip It was red velvet trim and it fit me good Standin' back from the lookin' glass There stood a woman where a half gown kid had stoodShe said here's your one chance Fancy don't let me down Here's your one chance Fancy don't let me downMama dabbed a little bit of perfume on my neck And she kissed my cheek Then I saw the tears wellin' up in her troubled eyes When she started to speak She looked at a pitiful shack And then she looked at me and took a ragged breath She said your Pa's run off and I'm real sick And the baby's gonna starve to deathShe handed me a heart shaped locket that said "To thine own self be true" And I shivered as I watched a roach crawl across The toe of my high heel shoe It sounded like somebody else that was talkin' Askin' Mama what do I do She said just be nice to the gentlemen Fancy And they'll be nice to youShe said here's your chance Fancy don't let me down Here's your one chance Fancy don't let me down Lord forgive me for what I do, but if you want out Well it's up to you Now don't let me down you better start movin' uptownWell, that was the last time I saw my Ma The night I left that rickety shack The welfare people came and took the baby Mama died and I ain't been backBut the wheels of fate had started to turn And for me there was no way out And it wasn't very long 'til I knew exactly What my Mama's been talkin' aboutI knew what I had to do but I made myself this solemn vow That I's gonna be a lady someday Though I don't know when or how I couldn't see spending the rest of my life With my head hung down in shame you know I might have been born just plain white trash But Fancy was my nameHere's your one chance Fancy don't let me down Here's your one chance Fancy don't let me downIt wasn't very long after a benevolent man Took me off the street And one week later I was pourin' his tea In a five room hotel suiteI charmed a king, a congressman And an occasional aristocrat Then I got me a Georgia mansion In an elegant New York townhouse flat And I ain't done badNow in this world there's a lot of self righteous hypocrite That would call me bad And criticize Mama for turning me out No matter how little we hadBut though I ain't had to worry 'bout nothin' For nigh on fifteen years I can still hear the desperation in my poor Mama's voice ringin' in my earShe said, here's your one chance Fancy don't let me down Here's your one chance Fancy don't let me down Lord, forgive me for what I do But if you want out well it's up to you Now don't let me down Your Mama's gonna help you uptownI guess she did
