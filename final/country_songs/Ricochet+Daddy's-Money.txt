Can't concentrate on the preacher preaching My attention span done turned off I'm honed in on that angel singing Up there in the choir loftShe's got her daddy's money, her mama's good looks More laughs than a stack of comic books A wild imagination, a college education Add it all up it's a deadly combinationShe's a good bass fisher, a dynamite kisser Country as a turnip green She's got her daddy's money, her mama's good looks And look who's lookin' at meHer second cousin was my third grade teacher I used to cut her grandma's grass Back then she was nothin' but knees and elbows Golly did she grow up fastShe's got her daddy's money, her mama's good looks More laughs than a stack of comic books A wild imagination, a college education Add it all up it's a deadly combinationShe's a good bass fisher, a dynamite kisser Country as a turnip green She's got her daddy's money, her mama's good looks And look who's lookin' at meLord if you got any miracles handy Maybe you could grant me one Just let me walk down the aisle and say, "I do" To that angel with a choir robe onShe's got her daddy's money, her mama's good looks More laughs than a stack of comic books A wild imagination, a college education Add it all up it's a deadly combinationShe's a good bass fisher, a dynamite kisser Country as a turnip green She's got her daddy's money, her mama's good looks And look who's lookin' at me She's got her daddy's money, her mama's good looks And she's lookin' at me
