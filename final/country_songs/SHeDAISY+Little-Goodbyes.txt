I'm gonna tell you something you don't want to hear You never listen when I talk, maybe you'll listen when I walk So I made up my mind and made a sandwich And I, I didn't shed a tear, I gave you one last minute of my time In this mess I left behindYou'll come home tonight And turn on the light Don't you be surprised to find My little goodbyesEmpty hangers by the closet door Lipstick tube on the bathroom floor Unpaid bills by the kitchen phone I took the Beatles, left Billy Joel My little goodbyes Little good, little goodbyesI'm sure you're sure I'll be back in just an hour or two You'll tape a hallmark to my door, they always said it better than you And if you're wonderin' when you're gonna hear from me Well take a real good look around boy and it won't be hard to seeYou come home tonight And turn on the light Don't you be surprised to find My little goodbyesTook your favorite Dodgers hat Left the litter, but I took the cat Loaded up the TV in the back of my car Have fun watching the V.C.R. My little goodbyes Oh baby, little good, little goodbyesSo cry to your mom And your sympathetic friends And tell them, tell them how the story endsTook the hourglass left the sand Now you got time on your hands Took the statue from Japan Funny little Buddha manChange my voice on the machine Or there'll be little goodbyes with every ring Left the pictures took the frames Got the umbrella, here comes the rainYeah, yeah, yeah Rain, yeah, yeah, yeah Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah Little goodbyes
