Natalie Wood gave her heart to James Dean High school rebel and the teenage queen Standing together in an angry world One boy fighting for one girlI want to be loved like that I want to be loved like that A promise, you can't take back If you're gonna love me I want to be loved like thatDaddy never gave momma a diamond ring Momma never worried for anything What he gave her came from the heart A bond that was never torn apartI want to be loved like that I want to be loved like that A promise, you can't take back If you're gonna love me I want to be loved like thatAn old man kneeling all alone Plants his flowers in a garden of stone For seven years now she's been gone And his devotion is still going strongI want to be loved like that I want to be loved like that A promise, you can't take back If you're gonna love me I want to be loved like that
