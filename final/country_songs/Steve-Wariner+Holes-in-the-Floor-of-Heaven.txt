One day shy of eight years old Grandma passed away I was a broken hearted little boy Blowing out that birthday cakeHow I cried when the sky let go With a cold and lonesome rain Momma smiled, said, "Don't be sad child Grandma's watchin' you today"'Cause there's holes in the floor of Heaven And her tears are pourin' down That's how you know she's watchin' Wishin' she could be here nowAnd sometimes if you're lonely Just remember she can see There's holes in the floor of Heaven And she's watchin' over you and meSeasons come and seasons go Nothin' stays the same I grew up, fell in love Met a girl who took my nameYear by year we made a life In this sleepy little town I thought we'd grow old together Lord I sure do miss her nowBut there's holes in the floor of Heaven And her tears are pourin' down That's how I know she's watchin' Wishin' she could be here nowAnd sometimes when I'm lonely I remember she can see There's holes in the floor of Heaven And she's watchin' over you and meWell my little girl is 23 I walk her down the aisle It's a shame her mom can't be here now To see her lovely smileThey throw the rice, I catch her eye As the rain starts comin' down She takes my hand says, "Daddy don't be sad 'Cause I know Momma's watchin' now"And there's holes in the floor of Heaven And her tears are pourin' down That's how you know she's watchin' Wishin' she could be here nowAnd sometimes when I'm lonely I remember she can see Yes, there's holes in the floor of Heaven And she's watchin' over you and meWatchin' over you and me Watchin' over you and me Watchin' over you and me
