Well, I've heard it said, "The grass is always greener" We want what we can't have or so it seems When I looked at you, the world never looked any sweeter And I go home to her and see you in my dreamsSo if you want someone to fill your wakin' hours With a love that is real, baby I'm still not free If you think you could fall for a telephone call and some flowers If you're dreamin' of someone you can dream of meWhen the stars are out, sometimes I still can remember The clear September night, we first met Through the fall I never looked at another Then the winter came how quickly we forgetSo if you want someone to fill your wakin' hours With a love that is real, baby I'm still not free If you think you could fall for a telephone call and some flowers If you're dreamin' of someone you can dream of meDream of me, I'll be dreamin' of you I'll never forget how you told me That your heart was taken too, you saidIf you want someone to fill your wakin' hours With a love that is real, baby I'm still not free If you think you could fall for a telephone call and some flowers If you're dreamin' of someone you can dream of meI'll be dreaming of you babe, you can dream of me
