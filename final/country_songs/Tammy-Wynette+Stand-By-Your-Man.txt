Sometimes it's hard to be a woman Giving all your love to just one man You'll have bad times And he'll have good times, Doin' things that you don't understandBut if you love him you'll forgive him, Even though he's hard to understand And if you love him oh be proud of him, 'cause after all he's just a manStand by your man, Give him two arms to cling to, And something warm to come to When nights are cold and lonelyStand by your man, And show the world you love him Keep giving all the love you can Stand by your manStand by your man, And show the world you love him Keep giving all the love you can Stand by your man
