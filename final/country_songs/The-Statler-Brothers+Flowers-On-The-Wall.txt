I've been hearin' you're concerned about my happiness But all that thought you're givin' me is conscience, I guess If I were walkin' in your shoes I wouldn't worry none While you and your friends are worryin' 'bout me, I'm havin' lots of funCountin' flowers on the wall that don't bother me at all Playin' solitaire till dawn with a deck of fifty one Smokin' cigarettes and watchin' Captain Kangaroo Now don't tell me, "I've nothing to do"Last night I dressed in tails pretended I was on the town As long as I can dream it's hard to slow this swinger down So please don't give a thought to me, I'm really doin' fine You can always find me here and havin' quite a timeCountin' flowers on the wall that don't bother me at all Playin' solitaire till dawn with a deck of fifty one Smokin' cigarettes and watchin' Captain Kangaroo Now don't tell me, "I've nothing to do"It's good to see you I must go, I know I look a fright Anyway my eyes are not accustomed to this light And my shoes are not accustomed to this hard concrete So I must go back to my room and make my day completeCountin' flowers on the wall that don't bother me at all Playin' solitaire till dawn with a deck of fifty one Smokin' cigarettes and watchin' Captain Kangaroo Now don't tell me, "I've nothing to do" Now don't tell me, "I've nothing to do"
