We were born in this little town, growin' up I was countin' down every single day 'Til we made our get awayBut you said you could never see yourself Tryin' to make a life anywhere else This would be your home and I was on my ownBut ever since you said good bye I've been out here on the wind And baby you would be surprised All the places you have beenI've seen you in Albuquerque, waitin' out a blizzard Arizona, dancin' 'cross the desert Watchin' the sun set in Monterey Girl, I swear just the other dayYou were down in Georgia, pickin' them peaches And Carolina, barefoot on the beaches No matter where you choose to be In my heart I'll always see you everywhereNow a days when I'm passin' through The conversation always turns to you And I hear you're doin' fine, livin' out by the county lineGot a man that's home every night A couple of kids and the kind of life that you want to lead Guess you could say the same for meBut you and I made our choices all those years ago Still I know I'll hear your voice And see you down the roadMaybe in Oklahoma, drivin' 'cross the prairie In Dallas, Texas isn't that where we always said We would like to try But never did so maybe that's whyYou're on every highway just beyond the high beams Right beside me in all of my sweet dreams No matter where you choose to be In my heart I'll always see youIn Albuquerque, waitin' out a blizzard And Arizona, dancin' 'cross the desert Watchin' the sun set in Monterey Girl, I swear just the other dayYou were down in Georgia, pickin' them peaches And Carolina, barefoot on the beaches No matter where you choose to be In my heart I'll always see you everywhere
