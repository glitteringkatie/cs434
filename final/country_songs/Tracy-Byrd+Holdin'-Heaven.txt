I'm face to face with an angel How'd you get those eyes so blue? You're a vision in white, and I've been waitin' all night Just to have one dance with you Now all my dreams are comin' trueI'm holdin' heaven in my arms tonight Everything about you is so perfectly right I've never been there, but I think I might Be holdin' heaven in my arms tonightI'm not sure where you came from But I thank my lucky stars above That I got the chance to have a dance But one dance just ain't enough I think I'm fallin' in loveI'm holdin' heaven in my arms tonight Everything about you is so perfectly right I've never been there, but I think I might Be holdin' heaven in my arms tonightI'm holdin' heaven in my arms tonight Everything about you is so perfectly right I've never been there, but I think I might Be holdin' heaven in my arms tonight I'm holdin' heaven in my arms tonight
