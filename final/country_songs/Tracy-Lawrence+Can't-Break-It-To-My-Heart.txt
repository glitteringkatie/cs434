I've never felt as helpless as I do today My world just fell around me as I watched you drive away There's nothing left between us somehow we've grown apart 'Cause I've got it through my head, I just can't break it to my heartI can't believe this is me on the hurtin' side of pain Sifting through the ashes still tryin' to find a flame But the flames have turned to embers left glowing in the dark Yes, I've got it through my head I just can't break it to my heartIf I could Lord knows I would spin back the hands of time And piece these scattered memories that are cluttered in my mind Or pick up where we left off and make a brand new start 'Cause I've got it through my head I just can't break it to my heartI can't believe this is me on the hurtin' side of pain Sifting through the ashes still tryin' to find a flame But the flames have turned to embers left glowing in the dark Oh, I've got it through my head I just can't break it to my heart Oh, I've got it through my head I just can't break it to my heartI just can't, I just can't break it to my heart I just can't, I just can't break it to my heart Just can't break it to my heart I just can't, I just can't break it to my heart
