(Travis Tritt)She stayed up all night and cried into her pillow And fought off the urge to just break down and call Last night to find the fault seemed so darn easy But now whose to blame don't matter much at all She thinks if she calls him it just shows weakness So the hurt goes on with every tear she's cried Ain't it sad to see a good love fall to pieces Chalk another heartbreak up to foolish prideTurn out the lights the competition's over The stubborn souls are the losers here tonight And while the bridges burn, another hard hard lesson's learned As through the ashes passion slowly dies And this romance goes down to foolish prideHe relives every word they spoke in anger He walks the floor and punches out the wall To apologize to her would be so simple But instead he cries I'll be damned if I'll crawl If he loses her he's lost his best friend And that's more then just a lover can provide So he wrestles with emotions that defeat him Chalk another love lost up to foolish prideTurn out the lights the competition's over The stubborn souls are the losers here tonight And while the bridges burn, another hard hard lesson's learned As through the ashes passion slowly dies And this romance goes down to foolish prideChalk another heartbreak up to foolish pride
