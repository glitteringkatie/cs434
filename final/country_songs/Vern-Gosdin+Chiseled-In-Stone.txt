You ran crying to the bedroom, I ran off to the bar Another peace of Heaven gone to Hell The words we spoke in anger just tore my world apart And I sat there feeling sorry for myselfThen that old man sat down beside me and looked me in the eye And he said, "Son, I know what youre going through" You ought a get down on your knees and thank your lucky stars That you got some one to go home toYou dont know about lonely or how long the nights can be Till youve lived through the stories that still living in me You dont know about sadness till you've faced life half alone You dont know about lonely till it's chiseled in stoneSo, I brought these pretty flowers hoping you would understand Sometimes a man is such a fool Those golden words of wisdom from the heart of that old man Showed me I aint nothing without youYou dont know about lonely or how long the nights can be Till youve lived through the stories that old man just told me And you dont know about sadness till youve faced life half alone You dont know about lonely till its chiseled in stone You dont know about lonely till its chiseled in stone
