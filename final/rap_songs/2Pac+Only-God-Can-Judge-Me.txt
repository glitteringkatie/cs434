Everybody's dyin' tell me what's the use of tryin' I've been Trapped since birth, cautious, cause I'm cursed And fantasies of my family, in a hearse And they say it's the white man I should fear But, it's my own kind doin' all the killin' here I can't lie, ain't no love for the other side Jealousy inside, make'em wish I died Oh my Lord, tell me what I'm livin' for Everybody's droppin' got me knockin' on heaven's door And all my memories, of seein' brothers bleed And everybody grieves, but still nobody sees Recollect your thoughts don't get caught up in the mix Cause the media is full of dirty tricks Only God can judge meOnly God can judge me, only God Only God can judge me nowFlatline!I hear the doctor standing over me Screaming I can make it Got a body full of bullet holes laying here naked Still I can't breathe, something's evil in my IV Cause everytime I breathe, I think they killing me I'm having nightmares, homicidal fantasies I wake up stranglin', danglin' my bed sheets I call the nurse cause it hurts, to reminisce How did it come to this?
