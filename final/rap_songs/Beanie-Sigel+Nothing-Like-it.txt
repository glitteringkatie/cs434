I'm just, I'm just a picture a picture in a frame I paint word pictures on the canvas of life But I don't control the colors It's nothin' like itYo, I'm ten steps ahead of niggas, that shit scary Sometimes I feel ahead of myself I hear this voice in the back of my mind Like "Mac maintain, just grind, dog, better yourself"So what I do? I take heed and pick up the pace Can't explain it when I pick up my son and look at my face I'm like a black rose growin' in the concrete crack in the pavement There that voice go again "Mac practice for greatnessGet paid for them immaculate statements" Keep thinkin' of them hotlines, like a physic, I can't explain it There's no pen when I write it There's nothin' like it, nothin' like itGod damn, what you want from me What you want me to tell you, huh? Niggas thought that I would stutter, huh, thought I was dumb But I ain't used to use my mind, I used to just use my 9 And run wild with my boys in the streets wild with these wars Now the Qu'ran and 48 laws, they polish my floorsI'm movin' niggas like puppets with no strings attached It's nothin' for Beans, so you know it ain't a thing for Mac To look in your eyes, see through your heart, know what you fearin' Pick you apart, like you niggas is transparentI see right through you niggas It's like Mac was born with advanced parents I'm like the sun shinin' at night imagine it dog I know you wanna see me gradually fallBut I'm walkin' on air, brakin' every gravity law It's nothin' like it, I swear, I spit words that skip through air Let the words of a true thug hit your ear It change colors like blue blood when it hit the air It's nothin' like it God damn, shit, I can't explain it, fuck y'all niggasI changed my whole life in about 9 months, just like sperm in a womb These young niggas never learn 'til they doomed Try to tell them "You can burn young punk, without smellin' the fuse" Make you shiver in the middle of JunePaintin' pictures so vivid, you can hang it up in your room Shine bright like a prism, displayin' colors like Crayola Think of the prisons with straight soldiers Think about the niggas who fucked us and played over usThink about the mothers who suffered and prayed over us Just look at the the picture I've painted, it's so perfect Open your eyes motherfuckers, you can't duck us No survivors every soul shall sufferI'm loadin' them revolvers every shell shall touch ya I promise I'll light your ass with these mags, I'ma bust ya God damn, it's nothin' like it, I'm serious Can't explain how I write it
