There's an angel in the sky watchin over me There's an angel in the sky watchin over meThey say it's always darkest before the dawn And that you don't know what you got until it's gone I thought I knew what I had but I was wrong And that's why I gots to write this song Now, come on, now, come onSay man, I thought it wouldve been a long time for us And many more years on the grind for us I thought the future held a lot for us both and it was brighter We were super tight but finna be super tighterI guess I just assumed we had more time for us To make more music and write more rhymes But never in my life could I ever have seen That I would ever have to lose the other half of my teamAnd take away the glitter the gold and the gleam Say man, I wonder to myself what does it all really mean? Nothing without the people you love, say man I miss my brother But I know he's looking down from above and theres an angelThere's an angel in the sky watchin over me There's an angel in the sky watchin over meIt all began on Shreveport Ave sittin off in the den Making beats and puttin paper to pen We was determined to win and you couldn't tell us different Mama West was cool with it but Monroe kept trippinIt seems just like yesterday sometime Sittin in your bedroom writing dumb rhymes Man, you makin beats on the Ensoniq And we was smokin dirt weed cause it wasn't no chronicI still remember when we started the crew It was me, Mitchell Queen, Jamal Jackson and you Started out as 4BM but then we ended with two Thats when we introduced the world to the UTo the G to the K, Underground Kings, DJ Byrd Pimp C and Bun B we kept it G, say word Who woulda known back in 92, in 2008 I'd have to Write this song sayin, I miss you but it's trueThere's an angel in the sky watchin over me There's an angel in the sky watchin over meJust for the record let me go ahead and say I love my brother Pimp C and man, I miss him everyday Yeah, my heart still hurts and the pains still fresh But I'ma put God first to keep that pressure off my chestAnd remind me that I'm blessed to have had him as a friend A ride or die homie that was with me till the end Real talk man, we was closer than kin And I know that I'll never have a partner like that againSo Chad Butler I just want you to know I keep your memory close, I'm never lettin it go And they gon always remember that you was here, mayne Cause I'ma make 'em remember, that's why I'm here, mayneYeah, it's still hard and I still cry But you and God keep me strong, so I'ma still try Reppin this UGK, now won't I?
