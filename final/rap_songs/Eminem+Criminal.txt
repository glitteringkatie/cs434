A lot of people ask me, stupid fuckin' questions A lot of people think that, what I say on record Or what I talk about on a record, that I actually do in real life Or that I believe in it Or if I say that, I want to kill somebody, that I'm actually gonna do it Or that I believe in it Well, shit, if you believe that Then I'll kill you You know why?Cause I'm a criminal! Criminal You god damn right I'm a criminal Yeah, I'm a criminalMy words are like a dagger with a jagged edge That will stab you in the head Whether you're a fag or les' Or the homo sex, hermaph', or a trans'a'vest' Pants or dress, hate fags? the answer's "yes" Homophobic? nah, you're just hetero phobic Starin' at my jeans, watchin' my genitals bulgin' (ooh!)
