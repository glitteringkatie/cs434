Daydream I fell asleep beneath the flowers For a couple of hours On a beautiful dayDaydream I dream of you amid the flowers For a couple of hours Such a beautiful dayAs I spy from behind my giant robot's eyes I keep 'em happy cause I might fall out if he cries Scared of heights, so I might pass out if he flies Keep 'em on autopilot cause I can't drive Room enough for one, I tell my homies they can't ride Unless they sittin' on the shoulders but that's way too high Let's try, not to step on the children, The news camera's filmin', this walkin', project building Now there's hoes selling hoes, like right around the toes And the crack heads beg, at about the lower leg There's crooked police, that's stationed at the knees And they do drive bys like up and down the thighs And there's car chase, going on at the waist Keep a vest on my chest I'm sitting in my room, as I'm looking out the face Somethin' to write about I still got some damage from fightin' the White House Just aDaydream I dream of you amid the flowers For a couple of hours Such a beautiful dayDaydream I dream of you amid the flowers For a couple of hours Such a beautiful dayNow come on everybody let's make cocaine cool We need a few more half naked women up in the pool And hold this mac 10 that's all covered in jewels And can you please put your titties closer to the 22's And where's the champagne, we need champagne Now look as hard as you can with this blunt in your hand And know hold up your chain, slow motion through the flames Now cue the smoke machines and the simulated rain But not too loud 'cause the baby's sleepin' I wonder if it knows what the world is keeping Up both sleeves while he lay there dreamin' Me and my robot tip toe round creepin' I had to turn my back on what got you paid I couldn't see half the hood on me like Abu Ghraib But I like to thank the streets that drove me crazy And all the televisions out there that raised me I wasDaydream I fell asleep beneath the flowers For a couple of hours Such a beautiful dayDaydream I fell asleep beneath the flowers For a couple of hours On a beautiful dayDaydream I fell asleep beneath the flowers For a couple of hours Such a beautiful dayDaydream I fell asleep beneath the flowers For a couple of hours Such a beautiful day
