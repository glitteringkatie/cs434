Can't keep runnin' awayI must admit on some occasions I went out like a punk And a chump or a sucka or something to that effect Respect, I used to never get when all I got was upset When niggas use to be like what's up fool?And tried to seat a nigga like the lip for no reason at all I can recall crip niggas throwin' C in my face down the hall I'm kickin' it in the back of the school, eatin' chicken at three Wonderin' why is everybody always pickin' on meI tried to talk and tell them chill, I did nothing to deserve this But when it didn't work I wasn't scared just real nervous And unprepared to deal with scrappin' no doubt 'Cuz my pappy never told me how to knock a nigga outBut now in 95 I must survive as a man on my own fuck Around with Fatlip yes, ya get blown' I'm not tryin' to show No macho is shown but when it's on, if it's on, then it's onThere comes a time in every man's life When he's gotta handle up on his own Can't depend on friends to help you in a squeeze Please, they got problems of their ownDown for the count on seven chickens Shits don't get to heaven till they faced these fears in these fear zones Used to get jacked back in high school I played It cool just so some real shit won't get full blown beingWhere I'm from they let the smoke come quicker Than an evil red neck could lynch a helpless colored figure And as a victim I invented low key till the keyhole itself got lower than me So I stood up and let my free form, form freeSaid I'm gonna get some before they knockin' out me I don't sweat it I let the bullshit blow in the breeze In other words just freezeIt's 1995 now that I'm older stress weighs on my shoulders Heavy as boulders but I told ya Till the day that I die I still will be a soldier and that's all I told Ya and that's all I showed yaAnd all this calamity is rippin' my sanity Can it be I'm a celebrity Whose on the brink of insanity Now don't be wishing of switchin' any positions with me'Cuz when you in my position, it ain't never easy To do any type of maintaining 'cuz all this gaming and famin' from Entertainin' is hella straining to the brain And but I can't keep runnin' I just gotta keep keen and cunnin'
