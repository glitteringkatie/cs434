(Chorus) Shes a fairy with broken wings I used to watch her perform And if she hears me I hope she sings songs That had me going right back Couldn't find anyone in town to talk About how no one like that Should be confined to the ground we walkShe glides but just seems like she floats And these folks decide to crush her wings until they're permanently broke She rides gusts of wind just by the way she spoke She crys but loves to sing songs of freedom and hope On the eastside hustling discussing things that we quote In shallow conversations as if we have deep throats We choke on our confusion Now show up as a heat stroke of we need coats Trading in our cheap jokes for her C notes I see notes being passed I ask to see what these creeps wrote Define silly kids and flying privileges revoked Ski slopes have been blocked off they can't chance it Had weights tied to her ankles she most definitely cant skip Down, she's held down by the transcripts my hands grip Tried to tie her wings back on before they're once again clipped Panic stricken, she'll remain stuck On a titantic sinking, shes trying to stay up Change her plan thinking it's OK See this is strange but Abraham Lincoln freed the slaves in a way that kept them chained up I'd like to see Her take flight into the stars Instead of letting her fly free they keep her in jars Instead of letting 'em fly free they keep 'em in jars I put my hand to the glass so hard that It might break the prison bars It isn't hard to see why they keep her captive Shes naturally attractive Speaks with adlibs, shes uncommonly talented Ain't enough adjectives to do her disposition justice Kids are wishing for just a kiss and its a mission to touch her lips They can't trust her with Freedom of movement thats a chance to lose her quick If she ups and splits We might as well call that discussion quits They have ways to keep her down the government's underlings Enslave people in this town especially if their culture's rich Exploiting talents making her do a bunch of tricks With the rest of the wingless imports Repeatedly told you aint a fairy, you just a bitch Just a bitch, with a butt thats thick So rub your tits, and thrust your hips And suck my dick, and run your shit, and run your shit, and run your shit(Chorus) Shes a fairy with broken wings I used to go watch her perform And if she hears me I hope she sings songs That had me going right back Couldnt find anyone in town to talk About how no one like that Should be confined to the ground(Verse Two) When I was down in New York she'd send me letters And I read her passages about how I left her to the savages No matter how sad that is I didnt cry Cause it was only a matter of time Before they figured me out and tried to strip my pride I knew the scoop Wish you could of seen the blueprints in my eye When I flew the coop Utilizing overground railroads in the sky It was live or die let me let you in on a secret of mine Me and you are different girl We dont even need wings to flyWe dont need wings to fly Me and you... we dont need wings to fly Keep on singing give it a try, give it a try Just keep on singing give it a try, give it a try (5x)
