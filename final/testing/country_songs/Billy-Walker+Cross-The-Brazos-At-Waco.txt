On the Chisholm trail, it was midnight Carmela was strong on his mind Because of the life he had chosen Carmela had left then behindToo long he'd been a bandito Carmela had left him alone But today someone brought a message She'd be seen in old San AntoneCross the Brazos at Waco Ride hard and I'll make it by dawn Cross the Brazos at Waco I'm safe when I reach San AntoneHe glanced back over his shoulder The posee was nowhere in sight He'd sent for Carmela to meet him On the banks of the Brazos tonightShe was waiting and he kept the promise He'd made such a long time ago As he dropped the guns that she hated In the mighty Brazos belowCross the Brazos at Waco Ride hard and I'll make it by dawn Cross the Brazos at Waco I'll walk straight in old San AntoneThen the night came alight with gun fire He knew that at last he'd been found As the ranger's band shoot brightly El bandito laid on the groundCarmela knew he was dying That all of her dreams were in vain As she kissed his lips for the last time She heard him whisper againCross the Brazos at Waco Ride hard and I'll make it by dawn Cross the Brazos at Waco I'm safe when I reach San AntoneI'm safe when I reach San Antone
