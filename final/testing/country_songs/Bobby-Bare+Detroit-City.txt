I wanna go home I wanna go home Ohh how I wanna go homeLast night I went to sleep in Detroit city And I dreamed about those cotton fields and home I dreamed about my mother, dear old papa, sister and brother I dreamed about that girl who's been waiting for so longI wanna go home I wanna go home Ohh how I wanna go homeHome folks think I'm big in Detroit city From the letters that I write they think I'm fine But by day I play the cards by night I make the bars If only they could read between the lines'Cause you know I rode the freight train north to Detroit city And after all these years, I find, I've just been wastin' my time So I just think I'll take my foolish pride And put it on a southbound freight and ride And go on back to the loved ones The ones that I left waitin' so far behindI wanna go home I wanna go home Oh how I wanna go home I wanna go home
