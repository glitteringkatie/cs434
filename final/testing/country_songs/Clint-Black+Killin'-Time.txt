You were the first thing that I thought of When I thought I drank you off my mind When I get lost in the liquor You're the only one I findIf I did the things I oughta You still would not be mine So I'll keep a tight grip on the bottle Gettin' loose and killin' timeThis killin' time, is killin' me Drinking myself blind, thinkin' I won't see That if I cross that line, an' they bury me Well I just might find, I'll be killin' time for eternityI don't know nothin' 'bout tomorrow I've been lost in yesterday I spent all my life just dying for A love that passed awayThere's an end to all my sorrow This is the only price I'll pay I'll be a happy man when I go And I can't wait another dayAn' this killin' time, is killin' me Drinking myself blind, thinkin' I won't see That if I cross that line, an' then they bury me Well I just might find, I'll be killin' time for eternity Well yes, I just might find, I'll be killin' time for eternity
