She said, "We're much too different We're from two separate worlds" And he admitted she was partly rightBut in his hearts defense he told her What they had in common Was strong enough to bond them for lifeHe said, "Look behind your own soul And the person that you'll see Just might remind you of me"I laugh, I love, I hope, I try I hurt, I need, I fear, I cry And I know you do the same things too So we're really not that different, me and youNow she could hardly argue With his pure and simple logic But logic never could convince a heartShe had always dreamed of loving Someone more exotic And he just didn't seem to fit the partSo she searched for greener pastures But never could forget What he whispered when she left"I laugh, I love, I hope, I try I hurt, I need, I fear, I cry And I know you do the same things too So we're really not that different, me and you"Was it time or was it truth? Maybe both lead her back to his door And as her tears fell at his feet She didn't say I love you, what she said meant even more"I laugh, I love, I hope, I try I hurt, I need, I fear, I cry And I know you do the same things too So we're really not that different No we're really not that different, me and you"
