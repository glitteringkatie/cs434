Well I pulled outta Pittsburgh a rollin' down that Eastern Seaboard I got my diesel wound up and she's a runnin' like a never before There's a speed zone ahead alright I don't see a cop in sight Six days on the road and I'm a gonna make it home tonight I got my ten forward gears and a Georgia overdrive I'm takin' little white pills and my eyes are open wide I just passed a Jimmy and a White I been a passin' everything in sight Six days on the road and I'm a gonna make it home tonight Well it seems like a month since I kissed my baby goodbye I could have a lotta women but I'm not like a some other guys I could find one to hold me tight but I could never make believe it's alright Six days on the road and I'm a gonna make it home tonight [ guitar ] ICC is a checkin' on down the line Well I'm a little overweight and my log book's way behind But nothin' bothers me tonight I can dodge all the scales alright Six days on the road and I'm a gonna make it home tonight Well my rig's a little old but that don't mean she's slow There's a flame from her stack and that smoke's a blowin' black as coal My hometown's a comin' in sight if you think I'm a happy you're right Six days on the road and I'm a gonna make it home tonight Six days on the road and I'm a gonna make it home tonight Six days on the road and I'm a gonna make it home tonight
