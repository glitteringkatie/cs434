Who doesn't know what I'm talking about Who's never left home, who's never struck out To find a dream and a life of their own A place in the clouds, a foundation of stoneMany precede and many will follow A young girl's dreams no longer hollow It takes the shape of a place out west But what it holds for her, she hasn't yet guessed[Chorus] She needs wide open spaces Room to make her big mistakes She needs new faces She knows the high stakesShe traveled this road as a child Wide eyed and grinning, she never tired But now she won't be coming back with the rest If these are life's lessons, she'll take this testShe needs wide open spaces Room to make her big mistakes She needs new faces She knows the high stakesShe knows the high stakesAs her folks drive away, her dad yells, "Check the oil!" Mom stares out the window and says, "I'm leaving my girl" She said, "It didn't seem like that long ago" When she stood there and let her own folks knowShe needed wide open spaces Room to make her big mistakes She needs new faces She knows the high stakesShe knows the high stakes She knows the highest stakes She knows the highest stakes She knows the highest stakes
