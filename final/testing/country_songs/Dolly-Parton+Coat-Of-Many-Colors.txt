Back through the years I go wonderin' once again Back to the seasons of my youth I recall a box of rags that someone gave us And how my momma put the rags to useThere were rags of many colors and every piece was small And I didn't have a coat and it was way down in the fall Momma sewed the rags together sewin' every piece with love She made my coat of many colors that I was so proud ofAs she sewed, she told a story from the Bible, she had read About a coat of many colors Joseph wore and then she said "Perhaps this coat will brang you good luck and happiness" And I just couldn't wait to wear it and momma blessed it with a kissMy coat of many colors that my momma made for me Made only from rags but I wore it so proudlyAlthough we had no money oh I was rich as I could be In my coat of many colors my momma made for meSo with patches on my britches, holes in both my shoes In my coat of many colors I hurried off to school Just to find the others laughing and making fun of me and my coat of many colors my momma made for meAnd oh I couldn't understand that for I thought I was rich And then I told them of the love my momma sewed in every stitch And I told 'em all the story momma told me while she sewed And why my coat of many colors was worth more than all their clothesThey didn't understand it and I tried to make them see One is only poor only if you choose to beIt is true we had no money but I was rich as I could be In my coat of many colors momma made for me Made just for me
