Coffee black, cigarettes Start this day, like all the rest First thing every morning that I do Is start missing youSome broken hearts never mend Some memories never end Some tears will never dry My love for you will never dieRendezvous in the night A willing woman to hold me tight But in the middle of love's embrace I see you're faceSome broken hearts never mend Some memories never end Some tears will never dry My love for you will never die
