I'm sending you a big bouquet of roses One for every time you broke my heart And as the door of love between us closes Tears will fall like petals when we partI begged you to be different but you'll always be untrue I'm tired of forgiving, now there's nothing left to do So I'm sending you a big bouquet of roses One for every time you broke my heartYou made our lover's lane a road of sorrow Till at last we have to say goodbye You're leaving me to face each new tomorrow With a broken heart you taught to cryI know that I should hate you after all you've put me through But how can I be bitter when I'm still in love with you So I'm sending you a big bouquet of roses One for every time you broke my heart
