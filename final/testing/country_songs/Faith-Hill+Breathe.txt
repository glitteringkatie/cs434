I can feel the magic floating in the air Being with you get's me that way I watch the sunlight dance across your face And I've never been this swept awayAll my thoughts just seem to settle on the breeze When I'm lying wrapped up in your arms The whole world just fades away The only thing I hear Is the beating of your heart[Chorus] 'Cause I can feel you breathe It's washing over me And suddenly I'm melting into you There's nothing left to prove Baby, all we need is just to be Caught up in the touch Slow and steady rush Baby, isn't that the way that love's suppose to be I can feel you breathe, just breatheIn a way I know my heart is waking up As all the walls come tumbling down Closer than I've ever felt before And I know, and you know There's no need for words right nowI can feel you breathe Washing over me And suddenly I'm melting into you There's nothing left to prove Baby, all we need is just to be Caught up in the touch Slow and steady rush Baby, isn't that the way that love's suppose to be I can feel you breathe, just breatheCaught up in the touch Slow and steady rush Baby, isn't that the way that love's suppose to be I can feel you breathe, just breatheI can feel the magic floating in the air Being with you gets me that way
