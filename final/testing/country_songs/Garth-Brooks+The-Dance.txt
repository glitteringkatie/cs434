Looking back On the memory of The dance we shared 'Neath the stars above For a moment All the world was right How could I have known That you'd ever say goodbyeAnd now I'm glad I didn't know The way it all would end The way it all would go Our lives Are better left to chance I could have missed the pain But I'd have had to miss The danceHolding you I held everything For a moment Wasn't I a king But if I'd only known How the king would fall Hey who's to say You know I might have changed it allAnd nowÂ I'm glad I didn't know The way it all would endÂ The way it all would go Our livesÂ Are better left to chanceÂ I could have missed the pain But I'd have had to missÂ The danceYes my life It's better left to chance I could have missed the pain But I'd have had to miss The dance
