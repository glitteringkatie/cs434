One has my name, the other has my heart With one I'll remain, that's how my heartaches start One has brown eyes, the other's eyes are blue To one I am tied, to the other I am trueOne has my love, the other only me But what good is love to an old heart that can't be free So I'll go on living my life just the same While one has my heart, the other has my nameAh, one has my name, the other has my heart With one I'll remain, oh, that's how my old heartaches start You know one's got brown eyes and the other's eyes are blue To one I am tied, to the other I guess I'll have to be trueOne that has my love and the other only me But what good is love to a heart that can't be free If I could live over, my life I would change The one who has my heart would also have my name
