Diablo motors had a hell of a sale, downtown yesterday Word got around, no money down, take years and years to pay When I got there the lot was bare, but the salesman said, "Hold on" For a little cash, I gotta two tone Nash out behind the barnIf the Devil danced in empty pockets, he'd have a ball in mine With a nine foot grand, a ten piece band and a twelve girl chorus line I'd raise some loot in a three piece suit, give 'em one dance for a dime If the Devil Danced in empty pockets, he'd have a ball in mineWell, he said, "Friend it ain't the end, let's see what I can do If you own a home, I've got a loan tailor made for you" Then above the racket a voice in my jacket said, "I'll tote the note" The Devil made me do it, talked me in to it and that was all she wroteIf the Devil danced in empty pockets, he'd have a ball in mine With a nine foot grand, a ten piece band and a twelve girl chorus line I'd raise some loot in a three piece suit, give 'em one dance for a dime If the Devil Danced in empty pockets, he'd have a ball in mineThey say debt is a bottomless pit where the Devil likes to play I'd sell my soul to get out of this hole, but there'd be hell to payIf the Devil danced in empty pockets, he'd have a ball in mine With a nine foot grand, a ten piece band and a twelve girl chorus line I'd raise some loot in a three piece suit, give 'em one dance for a dime If the Devil Danced in empty pockets, he'd have a ball in mine
