While she lays sleeping I stay out late at night and play my songs And sometimes, all the nights can be so long And it's good when I finally make it home All aloneWhile she lays dreaming I try to get undressed without the light And quietly she says, "How was your night?" And I come to her and say, "It was all right" And I hold her tightAnd she believes in me I'll never know just what she sees in me I told her someday, if she was my girl I could change the world with my little songs I was wrongBut she has faith in me And so I go on trying faithfully And who knows maybe, on some special night If my song is right, I will find a way Find a wayWhile she lays waiting I stumble to the kitchen for a bite Then I see my old guitar in the night Just waiting for me like a secret friend And there's no endWhile she lays crying I fumble with a melody or two And I'm torn between the things that I should do And she says to wake her up when I am through God, her love is trueAnd she believes in me I'll never know just what she sees in me I told her someday, if she was my girl I could change the world with my little songs I was wrongBut she has faith in me And so I go on trying faithfully And who knows maybe, on some special night If my song is right, I will find a way While she waits, while she waits for me
