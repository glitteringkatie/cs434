It comes from Mississippi, and down in Alabam Creepin' like a fever all across the land From deep in the Delta on the Louisiana shore The people got to have it, they wanna hear some moreIt's the hillbilly rock, beat it with a drum Playin' them guitars like shootin' from a gun Keepin' up the rhythm, steady as a clock Doin' a little thing called the hillbilly rockSome say it came from Memphis down in Tennessee Or it drifted in from Georgia about 1953 Just as long as it's greasy, as long as it's fast As long as it's pumpin' honey, it's gonna lastIt's the hillbilly rock, beat it with a drum Playin' them guitars like shootin' from a gun Keepin' up the rhythm, steady as a clock Doin' a little thing called the hillbilly rockWay back in old Kentucky where the bluegrass grows Through the Carolinas on them dirt red roads Burnin' like a fire runnin' wild in the woods From Arkansas to Texas, it sounds so goodIt's the hillbilly rock, beat it with a drum Playin' them guitars like shootin' from a gun Keepin' up the rhythm, steady as a clock Doin' a little thing called the hillbilly rockSo when the heat starts to risin' and you gotta blow some steam Take a ride down the river, you'll see just what I mean The juke joint's jumpin', when that cat goes on The whole place is shakin', there's a something goin' onIt's the hillbilly rock, beat it with a drum Playin' them guitars like shootin' from a gun Keepin' up the rhythm, steady as a clock Doin' a little thing called the hillbilly rock Doin' a little thing called the hillbilly rock Doin' a little thing called the hillbilly rock
