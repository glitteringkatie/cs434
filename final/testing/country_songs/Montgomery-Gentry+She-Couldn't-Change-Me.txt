Sometimes I think what turned her on was my old broke down boots She wanted her a real cowboy it was a phase she was just goin' through Not one week after she moved in I caught her paintin' the bedroom blue Brought home a bottle of pink chablis poured out my best home brew I was sittin' on the porch in my overalls as she packed her things to leave She changed her mind when she couldn't change meShe changed direction, headed out west Changed her tune to some hip hop mess Her dark brown hair went to blonde and her pretty blue eyes went to green She changed everything when she couldn't change meShe was sittin' beside the ocean looking out at the waves Watching how they keep on rolling but always seem the same She called and said she'd been thinkin' about all those quiet country nights And whatever she thought was so wrong with me suddenly seemed alright I was sittin' on the porch in my overalls when her truck pulled into view She said, "I changed my mind when I couldn't change you"She changed direction, headed back home She changed her tune it's all Haggard and Jones Had her dark brown hair pulled back and the bluest eyes you've ever seen She changed everything when she couldn't change meShe said, "I guess when you love someone just gotta let it be" She changed her mind, when she couldn't change meShe changed direction, she's back in my arms She thought it through, had a change of heart She said, "I guess when you love someone you just gotta let it be" She changed her mind, when she couldn't change me, yeah yeah She changed it all when she couldn't change me She couldn't change me, she couldn't change me
