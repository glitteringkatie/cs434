I want to ma ma ma ma marry you Ba Ba Ba Ba Ba Ba Ba Bobbie SueI'll take her riding on a Friday night Straight down the highway in the clear moonlight My Chevy's humming as she holds me tight We'll find a preacher and we'll do it rightHer daddy told her that she'd have to wait Her mama said, "Don't make a big mistake" But we'll keep driving till we're out of state And when they find us it'll be too lateBa Ba Ba Ba Bobbie Sue Can can't you see my love is true?
