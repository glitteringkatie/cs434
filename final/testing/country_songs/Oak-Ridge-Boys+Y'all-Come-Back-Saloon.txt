She played tambourine with a silver jingle And she must have known the words to at least a million tunes But the one most requested by the man she knew as Cowboy Was the late night benediction at the Y'all Come Back SaloonIn a voice soft and trembling, she'd sing her song to Cowboy As a smoky halo circled round her raven hair And all the fallen angels and pinball playing rounders Stopped the games that they'd been playing for the losers evening prayerFaded love and faded memories How they linger in her mind Miles and years played the Cowboy Like and old melody out of tune and out of timeEvery night in the shadows thinking back on Amarillo He'd dream of better days and ask for faded love Lifting high his glass in honor of the lady and her song He paid his check then lonely walked the broken cowboy homeShe played tambourine with a silver jingle And she must have known the words to at least a million tunes But the one most requested by the man she knew as Cowboy Was the late night benediction at the Y'all Come Back SaloonShe played tambourine with a silver jingle And she must have known the words to at least a million tunes But the one most requested by the man she knew as Cowboy Was the late night benediction at the Y'all Come Back SaloonShe played tambourine with a silver jingle And she must have known the words to at least a million tunes But the one most requested by the man she knew as Cowboy Was the late night benediction at the Y'all Come Back Saloon
