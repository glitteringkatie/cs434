I go out walkin' after midnight Out in the moonlight just like we used to do I'm always walkin' after midnight searchin' for youI walk for miles along the highway Well that's just my way of sayin' I love you I'm always walkin' after midnight, searchin' for youI stop to see a weepin' willow Cryin' on his pillow, maybe he's cryin' for me And as the skies turn gloomy Night winds whisper to me, I'm lonesome as I can beI go out walkin' after midnight Out in the moonlight, just hopin' you may be Somewhere a walkin' after midnight, searchin' for meI stop to see a weepin' willow Cryin' on his pillow, maybe he's cryin' for me And as the skies turn gloomy Night winds whisper to me, I'm lonesome as I can beI go out walkin' after midnight Out in the moonlight, just hopin' you may be Somewhere a walkin' after midnight, searchin' for me
