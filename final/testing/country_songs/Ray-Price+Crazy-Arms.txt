Now blue ain't the word for the way that I feel And the storm's brewing in this heart of mine This ain't no crazy dream I know that it's real You're someone else's love now you're not mineCrazy arms that reach to hold somebody new While my yearning heart keeps saying you're not mine My troubled mind knows soon to another you'll be wed And that's why I'm lonely all the timeSo please take the treasured dreams I have for you and me And take all the love I thought was mine Someday my crazy arms may hold somebody new But now I'm so lonely all the timeCrazy arms that reach to hold somebody new While my yearning heart keeps saying you're not mine My troubled mind knows soon to another you'll be wed And that's why I'm lonely all the time
