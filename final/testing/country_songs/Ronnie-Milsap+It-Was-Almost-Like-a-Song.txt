Once in every life Someone comes along And you came to me It was almost like a songYou were in my arms Right where you belong And we were so in love It was almost like a songJanuary through December We had such a perfect year Then the flame became a dying ember All at once you weren't hereNow my broken heart Cries for you each night And it's almost like a song But it's much too sad to writeNow my broken heart Cries for you each night And it's almost like a song But it's much too sad to writeIt's too sad to write
