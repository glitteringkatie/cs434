From the great Atlantic ocean to the wide Pacific shore From the queen of flowing mountain to the south bell by the shore She's mighty tall and handsome and know quite well by all She's the combination on the Wabash CannonballShe came down from Birmingham one cold December day As she rolled in the station you could hear all the people say There's a girl from Tennessee she's long and she's tall She came down from Birmingham on the Wabash CannonballOur estern states are dandies so the people always say From New York to St. Louis and Chicago by the way From the hills of Minnesota where the rippling waters fall No changes can be taken on the Wabash CannonballHere's to daddy Claxton may his name forever stand And always be remembered 'round the courts of Alabama His earthly race is over and the curtains 'round him fall We'll carry home to victory on the Wabash CannonballListen to the jingle the rumble and the roar As she glides along the woodland through the hills and by the shore Hear the mighty rush of the engine hear the lonesome hobos call You're traveling through the jungle on the Wabash Cannonball
