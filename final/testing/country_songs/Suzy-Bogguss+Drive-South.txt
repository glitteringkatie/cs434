I didn't say, we wouldn't hurt anymore That's how you learn, you just get burned We don't have to feel like dirt anymore Though love's not learned, baby it's our turnWe were always lookin' for true love With our heads in the clouds Just a little off course But I left that motor runnin' Now if you're feelin' down and outCome on baby drive South With the one you love Come on baby drive SouthI'm not talkin' about retreatin', no sir Gonna take our stand in this Chevy van Windows open on the rest of the world Holdin' hands all the way to DixielandWe've been tryin' to turn our lives around Since we were little kids It's been wearin' us down Don't turn away now darlin' Let's fire it up and wind it outCome on baby drive South With the one you love Come on baby drive SouthI heard your momma callin' I think, she was only stallin' Don't know who she's talkin' to Baby me an' youWe can go south with a smile on Ain't going to pack my nylons Just leave these legs showin' It gets hot down where were goin'We were always lookin' for true love With our heads in the clouds Just a little off course But I left that motor runnin' Now if you're feelin' down and outCome on baby drive Come on baby drive South With the one you loveCome on baby drive South With the one you love Come on baby drive South
