On a greyhound bus Lord, I'm travelin' this morning I'm goin' to Shreveport And down to New OrleansBeen travelin' these highways Been doin' things my way It's been making me lonesome On'ry and meanNow her hair was jet black And her name was Bodine Thought she was the cream Of the basin street queensShe got tired Of that smoky wine dream She began to feel lonesome On'ry and meanWe got together And we cashed in our sweeps Gave onto a beggar Who was mumblin' through the streetsThere's no escaping From his snowy white dream On'ry and lonesome On'ry and meanI'm down in this valley Where the wheels turn so low At dawn I pray To the Lord of my soulI say do Lord Do right by me You know I'm tired of being lonesome On'ry and mean
