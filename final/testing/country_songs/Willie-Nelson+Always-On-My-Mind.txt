Maybe I didn't love you Quite as often as I could have Maybe I didn't treat you Quite as good as I should haveIf I made you feel second best Girl I'm sorry I was blind You were always on my mind You were always on my mindMaybe I didn't hold you All those lonely, lonely times And I guess I never told you I'm so happy that you're mineLittle things I should have said and done I just never took the time You were always on my mind You were always on my mindTell me Tell me that your sweet love hasn't died And give me Give me one more chance to keep you satisfied I'll keep you satisfiedLittle things I should have said and done I just never took the time You were always on my mind You were always on my mindYou were always on my mind You were always on my mind
