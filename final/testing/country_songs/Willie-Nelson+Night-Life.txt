When the evenin' sun goes down You will find me hangin' 'round The night life ain't no good life But it's my lifeMany people just like me Dreamin' of old used to be's And the night life ain't no good life But it's my lifeListen to the blues they're playin' Listen to what the blues are sayin'Mine is just another scene From the world of broken dreams And the night life ain't no good life But it's my life The night life ain't no good life But it's my life
