Life goes on in the streets of my hood when you die But some cry, and gets by, while others choose to wonder why His life was took at such an early age A young nigga who lived in a rage died by the gageHe used to hustle on the street corners His mom would always beg him to quit, but he didn't wanna As he got older, he got even worse 'Til a real nigga showed him the purpose of a hearseA cold night in his hood, he had a tangle The brother he was squabblin' with, had broke his ankle Laid him out in the driveway Some people knew he wouldn't survive, but heyI ain't the one to speak up on another's All I can do is try to open his eyes and help the brother He chose the wrong way and that's the route he took Born and brought up as an angel but he died as a crookHe had a baby that he couldn't raise And she will never see her father again, 'cause he's in a grave I always think about [Incomprehensible] "My daddy was a dopeman, so I'ma be a dope dealer"How will the family explain it? "My daughter had a baby for a 'caine head" He ain't around to see her walk Dry her eyes when she cries, pick her up when she fallsJust the thought of a kid livin' fly fucks me up When his girl has to raise a bastard child It gets deeper, he used to punch her and beat her She was loyal to his ass but accused as a cheaterShe had a good deck but she picked the wrong card Had a kid, now she's realizin' life is hard A big time dope dealer's all she wanted Who drove a Jag or a Benz so she could flaunt itThe situation's got me guessin' But the answer remains to be a question He lived his life in a lie I guess you only get a minute to pray, and a second to dieIt was crazy how it happened Some niggaz rolled by in the Riviera cappin' All I could see was a pistol spittin' rounds And the boy was just screamin' as he fell to the groundA woman yelled, "Get an ambulance" But I knew he was dead, he didn't stand a chance You shoulda seen him, he was scared A bullet goes to his chest, and one to his headHe just laid there in silence And all I heard was the siren Paramedics pulled up Followed by a law man and in came a firetruckPut his ass on the stretcher But if he survives, I'm willin' to betcha He'll be out for revenge They patched him up within a week, he was back at it againWent to his brother on the North side Grab your shit, it's a hit, we're gonna take a long ride Packed it up in the trunk AK 47, M 11 and a pumpRolled by [Incomprehensible] on Scott Street School was lettin' out "Yo you ain't gonna shoot yet?", Watch me Opened his trunk and grabbed a shotgun, he shot himPut his tooly on the front seat Continued his mission, as he headed down the street The kids was just starin' at each other J.D. rolled by and smoked black's brotherReached in his coat and grabbed a 'port Full speed down Reed, shot his mom on the porch On his way down Collard His brother was just dazed in a shock, "Why you do it?"Why you shot his moms Jay?
