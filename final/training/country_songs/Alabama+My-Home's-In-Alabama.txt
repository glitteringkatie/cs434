Drinkin' was forbidden in my Christian country home I learned to play the flattop on 'em good old gospel songs Then I heard about the barrooms just across the Georgia line Where a boy could make a livin' playin' guitar late at nightHad to learn about the ladies too young to understand Why the young girls fall in love with the boys in the band When the boys turn to music, the girls just turn away To some other guitar picker in some other late night placeYeah, held on to my music, let the ladies walk away Took my songs and dreams to Nashville and then on to L.A Up to New York city, all across the USA I've lost so much of me but there's enough of me to sayThat my home's in Alabama, no matter where I lay my head My home's in Alabama, southern born and southern bredWhat keeps me goin' I don't really know Can't be the money Lord knows I'm always broke Could it be the satisfaction of bein' understood When the people really love you and let you know when it's goodOh, I'll speak my southern English as natural as I please I'm in the heart of Dixie, Dixie's in the heart of me And someday when I make it, when love finds a way Somewhere high on lookout mountain I'll just smile with pride and sayThat my home's in Alabama, no matter where I lay my head My home's in Alabama, southern born and southern bred Southern born and southern bred, southern born and southern bred
