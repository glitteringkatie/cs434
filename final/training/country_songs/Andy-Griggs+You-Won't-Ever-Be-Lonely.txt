Life may not always go your way And every once in a while you might have a bad day But I promise you now you won't ever be lonelyThe sky turns dark and everything goes wrong Run to me and I'll leave the light on And I promise you now you won't ever be lonelyFor as long as I live there will always be a place you belong Here beside me, heart and soul baby you only And I promise you now you won't ever be lonelyIt's still gonna snow and it's still gonna rain The wind's gonna blow on a cold winter day And I promise you now you won't ever be lonelyYou're safe from the world wrapped in my arms And I'll never let go baby, here's where it starts And I promise you now you won't ever be lonelyHere's a shoulder you can cry on And a love you can rely onFor as long as I live there will always be a place you belong Here beside me, heart and soul baby you only And I promise you now you won't ever be lonely No, no, no, no, no, no, no you won't ever be lonely
