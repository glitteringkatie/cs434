When a single mom goes out on a date with somebody new And it always winds up being more like a job interview My momma used to wonder if she'd ever meet someone Who wouldn't find out about me and then turn around and runI met the man I call my Dad when I was five years old He took my Mom out to a movie and for once I got to go A few months later I remember lying there in bed I overheard him pop the question and I prayed that she'd say yesAnd then all of a sudden oh it seemed so strange to me How we went from somethings missing to a family Lookin' back all I can say about all the things he did for me Is I hope I'm at least half the Dad that he didn't have to beI met the girl that's now my wife about three years ago We had the perfect marriage but we wanted somethin' more Now here I stand surrounded by our family and friends Crowded 'round the nursery window as they bring the baby inAnd now all of a sudden oh it seemed so strange to me How we've gone from somethings missing to a family Lookin' through the glass I think about the man that's standin' next to me And I hope I'm at least half the Dad that he didn't have to beAnd lookin' back all I can say about all the things he did for me Is I hope I'm at least half the Dad that he didn't have to be Yeah, I hope I'm at least half the Dad that he didn't have to be Because he didn't have to be, you know he didn't have to be
