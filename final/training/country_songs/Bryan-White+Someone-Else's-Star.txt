Alone again tonight Without someone to love The stars are shining bright So one more wish goes upOh, I wish I may And I wish with all my might For the love Im dreaming of And missing in my lifeYoud think that I could find A true love of my own It happens all the time To people that I knowTheir wishes all come true So Ive got to believe Theres still someone out there who Is meant for only meI guess I must be wishing on Someone elses star It seems like someone else keeps getting What Im wishing forWhy cant I be as lucky As those other people are I guess I must be wishing On someone elses starI sit here in the dark And stare up at the sky But I cant give my heart One good reason whyEverywhere I look Its lovers that I see It seems like everyones in love With everyone but meI guess I must be wishing on Someone elses star It seems like someone else keeps getting What Im wishing forWhy cant I be as lucky As those other people are Oh, I guess I must be wishing On someone elses starWhy cant I be as lucky As those other people are Oh, I guess I must be wishing On someone elses star
