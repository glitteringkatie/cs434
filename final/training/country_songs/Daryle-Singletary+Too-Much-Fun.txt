He smiled and said, "Boy you're having too much fun"Too much fun, what's that mean? It's like too much money, there's no such thing It's like a girl too pretty with too much class Being too lucky, a car too fast No matter what they say, I've done But I ain't never had too much funThere was a fight Friday night at the stumble inn Me and 'ole Harley just had to join in Next thing you know we were both seeing stars They threw us out, closed down the bar I said, "The Long Branch is open the night's still young And we ain't never had too much fun"Too much fun, what's that mean? It's like too much money, there's no such thing It's like a girl too pretty with too much class Being too lucky, a car too fast No matter what they say, I've done But I ain't never had too much funI'm a holly terror, a tornado Wind me up, turn me loose and let me goToo much fun, what's that mean? It's like too much money, there's no such thing It's like a girl too pretty with too much class Being too lucky, a car too fast No matter what they say, I've done But I ain't never had too much funNo matter what they say, I've done Well, we ain't never had to much fun Give me the reigns and let me run 'Cause I ain't never had to much fun
