He was working through college On my Grandpa's farm I was thirsting for knowledge And he had a carYeah, I was caught somewhere between A woman and a child One restless summer We found love, growing wildOn the banks of the river, on a well beaten path It's funny how those memories they lastLike strawberry wine and seventeen The hot July moon saw everything My first taste of love, oh, bittersweet The green on the vine like strawberry wineI still remember When thirty was old My biggest fear was September When he had to goA few cards and letters and one long distance call We drifted away like the leaves in the fall But year after year, I come back to this place Just to remember the tasteOf strawberry wine and seventeen The hot July moon saw everything My first taste of love, oh, bittersweet The green on the vine like strawberry wineThe fields have grown over now, years since they've seen a plow There's nothing time hasn't touched Is it really him or the loss of my innocence I've been missing so much? YeahStrawberry wine and seventeen The hot July moon saw everything My first taste of love, oh, bittersweet And green on the vineLike strawberry wine and seventeen The hot July moon saw everything My first taste of love, oh, bittersweet The green on the vine like strawberry wineStrawberry wine Strawberry wine
