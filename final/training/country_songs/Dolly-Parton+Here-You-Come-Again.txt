Here you come again Just when I'm about to get myself together You waltz right in the door, just like you've done before And wrap my heart 'round your little fingerHere you come again Just when I'm about to make it work without you You look into my eyes and light those dreamy eyes And pretty soon I'm wonderin' how I came to doubt youAll you gotta do is smile that smile And there go all my defenses Just leave it up to you and in a little while You're messin' up my mind an' fillin' up my sensesHere you come again Lookin' better than a body has a right to An' shakin' me up so, that all I really know Is here you come again an' here I goAll you gotta do is smile that smile And there go all my defenses Just leave it up to you and in a little while You're messin' up my mind an' fillin' up my sensesHere you come again Lookin' better than a body has a right to An' shakin' me up so, that all I really know Is here you come again an' here I goHere I go An' here I go An' here I goHere you come again An' here I go Here I go An' here I go
