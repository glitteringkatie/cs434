I left Oklahoma, drivin' in a Pontiac Just about to lose my mind I was goin' to Arizona, maybe on to California Where the people all live so fineMy baby said I was crazy My Momma called me lazy I was goin' to show 'em all this time 'Cause you know I ain't no fool An' I don't need no more schoolin' I was born to just walk the lineLivin' on Tulsa time, livin' on Tulsa time Well, you know I've been through it When I set my watch back to it Livin' on Tulsa timeWell, there I was in Hollywood Wishin' I was doin' good Talkin' on the telephone line But they don't need me in the movies And nobody sings my songs Guess I'm just wastin' timeWell, then I got to thinkin' Man, I'm really sinkin' And I really had a flash this time I had no business leavin' And nobody would be grievin' If I went on back to Tulsa timeLivin' on Tulsa time, livin' on Tulsa time Gonna set my watch back to it 'Cause you know I've been through it Livin' on Tulsa timeLivin' on Tulsa time, livin' on Tulsa time Gonna set my watch back to it 'Cause you know I've been through it Livin' on Tulsa time
