Kiss me each morning for a million years Hold me each evening by your side Tell me you love me for a million years Then if it don't work out, then if it don't work out Then you can tell me goodbyeSweeten my coffee with a morning kiss Soften my dreams with your sigh After you've loved me for a million years Then if it don't work out, then if it don't work out Then you can tell me goodbyeIf you must go I won't grieve If you'll just wait a lifetime before you leaveBut if you must go I won't say no Just so we can say that we tried Tell me you love me for a million years Then if it don't work out, then if it don't work out Then you can tell me goodbye Then you can tell me goodbye
