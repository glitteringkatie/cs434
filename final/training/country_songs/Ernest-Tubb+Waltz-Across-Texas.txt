When we dance together my world's in disguise It's a fairyland tale that come true And when you look at me with those stars in your eyes I could waltz across Texas with youWaltz across Texas with you in my arms Waltz across Texas with you Like a storybook ending I'm lost in your charms And I could waltz across Texas with youMy heartaches and troubles are just up and gone The moment that you come in view And with your hand in mine dear I could dance on and onWaltz across Texas with you in my arms Waltz across Texas with you Like a storybook ending I'm lost in your charms And I could waltz across Texas with you
