Hello walls (Hello hello) How things go for you today Don't you miss her Since she upped and walked away And I'll bet you dread to spend another lonely night with me But lonely walls I'll keep you companyHello window (Hello hello) Well I see that you're still here Aren't you lonely Since our darling disappeared Well look here is that a teardrop in the corner of your pane Now don't you try to tell me that it's rainShe went away and left us all alone the way she planned Guess we'll have to learn to get along without her if we canHello ceiling (Hello hello) I'm gonna stare at you a while You know I can't sleep So won't you bear with me a while We've gotta all stick together or else I'll lose my mind I've got a feeling she'll be gone a long long time (Hello hello)
