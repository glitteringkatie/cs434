From a phone booth in Cheyenne I made a promise to Diane No more rodeos I'd gone my last go 'roundThe same promise that I made In San Antone and Santa Fe But tonight I saddled up And let her downWild horses keep draggin' me away And I'll lose more than I'm gonna win someday Wild horses just stay wild and her heart is all I break Wild horses keep draggin' me awayShe'll watch me drive around her block Gettin' courage up to stop To make her one more promise That I can't keepThe way I love the rodeo I guess I should let her go Before I hurt her more Than she loves meWild horses keep draggin' me away And I'll lose more than I'm gonna win someday Wild horses just stay wild and her heart is all I break Wild horses keep draggin' me away
