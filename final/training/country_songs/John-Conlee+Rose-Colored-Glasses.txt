I don't know why I keep on believing you need me When you've proved so many times that it ain't true And I can't find one good reason for staying Maybe by leaving would be the best for youBut these rose colored glasses That I'm looking through Show only the beauty 'Cause they hide all the truthAnd they let me hold on to the good times, good lines The ones I used to hear when I held you And they keep me from feeling so cheated, defeated When reflections in your eyes show me a foolThese rose colored glasses That I'm looking through Show only the beauty 'Cause they hide all the truthSo I just keep on hopin', believing That maybe by counting the many times, I've tried You'll believe me when I say, I love you And I'll lay these rose colored glasses asideThese rose colored glasses That I'm looking through Show only the beauty 'Cause they hide all the truth
