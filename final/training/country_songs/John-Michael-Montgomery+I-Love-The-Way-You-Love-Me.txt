I like the feel of your name on my lips And I like the sound of your sweet gentle kiss The way that your fingers run through my hair And how your scent lingers even when your not thereAnd I like the way your eyes dance when you laugh And how you enjoy your two hour bath And how you convinced me to dance in the rain With everyone watching like we were insaneBut I love the way you love me Strong and wild Slow and easy Heart and soul So completely I love the way you love meI like to imitate old Jerry Lee And watch you roll your eyes when I'm slightly off key And I like the innocent way that you cry At sappy old movies you've seen hundreds of timesBut I love the way you love me Strong and wild Slow and easy Heart and soul So completely I love the way you love meAnd I could list a million things I love to like about you But they all come down to one reason I could never live without youI love the way you love me Strong and wild Slow and easy Heart and soulSo completely I love the way you love me Oh baby I love the way you love me
