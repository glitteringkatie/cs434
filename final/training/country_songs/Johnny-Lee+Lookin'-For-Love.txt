I spent a lifetime lookin' for you Single bars and good time lovers were never true Playing a fools game, hopin' to win Tellin' those sweet lies and losin' again.ChorusI was lookin' for love in all the wrong places Lookin' for love in too many places Searchin' her eyes, lookin' for traces Of what I'm dreamin' of Hoping to find a friend and a lover I'll bless the day I discover, You   lookin' for love.I was alone then, no love in site I did every thing I could to get me through the night Don''t know where it started or where it might end I'd turn to a stranger just like a friend.
