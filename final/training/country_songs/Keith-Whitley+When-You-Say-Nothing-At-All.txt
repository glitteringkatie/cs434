It's amazing how you can speak right to my heart Without saying a word, you can light up the dark Try as I may I could never explain What I hear when you don't say a thingThe smile on your face let's me know that you need me There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me The touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall Yeah, you say it best when you say nothing at allAll day long I can hear people talking out loud But when you hold me near, you drown out the crowd Old Mr. Webster could never define What's being said between your heart and mineThe smile on your face let's me know that you need me There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me The touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall Yeah, you say it best when you say nothing at allThe smile on your face let's me know that you need me There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me The touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall Yeah, you say it best when you say nothing at all
