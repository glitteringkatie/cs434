In a bar in Toledo across from the depot On a bar stool she took off her ring I thought I'd get closer so I walked on over I sat down and asked her name When the drinks finally hit her She said I'm no quitter but I finally quit livin on dreams I'm hungry for laughter and here ever after I'm after whatever the other life bringsIn the mirror I saw him and I closely watched him I thought how he looked out of place He came to the woman who sat there be side me He had a strange look on his face The big hands were calloused he looked like a mountain For a minute I thought I was dead But he started shaking his big heart was breaking He turned to the woman and saidYou picked a fine time to leave me Lucille With four hungry children and a crop in the field I've had some bad times lived through some sad times But this time your hurting won't heal You picked a fine time to leave me Lucille.After he left us I ordered more whiskey I thought how she'd made him look small From the lights of the bar room To a rented hotel room We walked without talking at all She was a beauty but when she came to me She must have thought I'd lost my mind I couldn't hold her 'cos the words that told her Kept coming back time after timeYou picked a fine time to leave me Lucille With four hungry children and a crop in the field I've had some bad times lived through some sad times But this time your hurting won't heal You picked a fine time to leave me Lucille.
