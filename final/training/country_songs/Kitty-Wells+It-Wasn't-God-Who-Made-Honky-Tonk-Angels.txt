As I sit here tonight, the jukebox playin' The tune about the wild side of life As I listen to the words you are sayin' It brings memories when I was a trustful wifeIt wasn't God who made honky tonk angels As you said in the words of your song Too many times married men Think they're still single That has caused many a good girl to go wrongIt's a shame that all the blame is on us women It's not true that only you men feel the same From the start Most every heart that's ever broken Was because there always was a man to blameIt wasn't God who made honky tonk angels As you said in the words of your song Too many times married men Think they're still single That has caused many a good girl to go wrong
