If tomorrow all the things were gone I worked for all my life And I had to start again With just my children and my wifeI thank my lucky stars To be living here today 'Cause the flag still stands for freedom And they can't take that awayAnd I'm proud to be an American Where at least I know I'm free And I won't forget the men who died Who gave that right to me And I'd gladly stand up next to you And defend Her still today 'Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land God Bless the U.S.A.From the lakes of Minnesota To the hills of Tennessee Across the plains of Texas From sea to shining seaFrom Detroit down to Houston And New York to L.A. Where's pride in every American heart And it's time we stand and sayThat I'm proud to be an American Where at least I know I'm free And I won't forget the men who died Who gave that right to me And I'd gladly stand up next to you And defend Her still today 'Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land God Bless the U.S.A.And I'm proud to be an American Where at least I know I'm free And I won't forget the men who died Who gave that right to me And I'd gladly stand up next to you And defend Her still today 'Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land God Bless the U.S.A.
