Sure I think about you now and then But it's been a long, long time I've got a good life now, I moved on So when you cross my mindI try not to think about what might have been 'Cause that was then and we have taken different roads We can't go back again there's no use giving in And there's no way to know what might have beenWe can sit and talk about this all night long And wonder why we didn't last Yes, they might be the best days we will ever know But we'll have to leave them in the pastSo try not to think about what might have been 'Cause that was then and we have taken different roads We can't go back again there's no use giving in And there's no way to know what might have beenThat same old look in your eyes It's a beautiful night, I'm so tempted to stay But too much time has gone by We should just say goodbye and turn and walk awayAnd try not to think about what might have been 'Cause that was then and we have taken different roads We can't go back again there's no use giving in And there's no way to know what might have been No, we'll never know what might have been
