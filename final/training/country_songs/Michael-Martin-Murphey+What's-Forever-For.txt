I've been looking at people And how they change with the times And lately all I've been seeing are people Throwing love away and losing their mindsOr maybe it's me that's gone crazy 'Cause I can't understand why All these people keep hurting each other When good love is so hard to come bySo what's the glory in living Doesn't anybody ever stay together anymore And if love never lasts forever Tell me what's forever forI've been listening to people And they say love is the key It's not my way to let them lead me astray It's only that I want to believeBut I see love hungry people Trying their best to survive While in their hands is a dying romance And they're not even trying to keep it aliveSo what's the glory in living Doesn't anybody ever stay together anymore And if love never lasts forever Tell me what's forever for And if love never lasts forever Tell me what's forever for
