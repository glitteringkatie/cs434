I fall to pieces each time I see you again I fall to pieces, how can I be just your friendYou want me to act like we've never kissed You want me to forget, pretend we've never met And I've tried and I've tried but I haven't yet You walk by and I fall to piecesI fall to pieces each time someone speaks your name I fall to pieces time only adds to the flameYou tell me to find someone else to love Someone who'll love me, too, the way you used to do But each time I go out with someone new You walk by and I fall to pieces You walk by and I fall to pieces
