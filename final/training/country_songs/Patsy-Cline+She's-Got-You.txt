I've got your picture that you gave to me And it's signed with love, just like it used to be The only thing different, the only thing new I've got your picture, she's got youI've got the records that we used to share And they still sound the same as when you were here The only thing different, the only thing new I've got the records, she's got youI've got your memory or has it got me? I really don't know but I know it won't let me beI've got your class ring that proved you cared And it still looks the same as when you gave it dear The only thing different, the only thing new I've got these little things, she's got youI've got your memory or has it got me? I really don't know but I know it won't let me beI've got your class ring that proved you cared And it still looks the same as when you gave it dear The only thing different, the only thing new I've got these little things, she's got you
