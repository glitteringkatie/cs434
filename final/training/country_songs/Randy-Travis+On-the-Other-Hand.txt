On one hand I count the reasons I could stay with you And hold you close to me All night long So many lover's games I'd love to play with you On that hand there's no reason Why it's wrongBut on the other hand There's a golden band To remind me of someone Who would not understand On one hand I could stay (Aah) And be your lovin' man But the reason I must go Is on the other handIn your arms I feel the passion I thought had died When I looked into your eyes I found myself And when I first kissed your lips I felt so alive I've got to hand it to you girl You're somethin' elseBut on the other hand There's a golden band To remind me of someone Who would not understand On one hand I could stay (Aah) And be your lovin' man But the reason I must go Is on the other hand Yea the reason I must go Is on the other hand
