I've been tellin' my dreams to the scarecrow About the places that I'd like to see I say, "Friend do you think I'll ever get there?" Oh, but he just stands there smilin' back at meSo I confess my sins to the preacher About the love I'd been prayin' to find Is there a brown eyed boy in my future? And he says, "Girl, you've got nothin' but time"But how do you wait for Heaven? And who has that much time? And how do you keep your feet on the ground? When you know that you were born, you were born to flyMy daddy, he is grounded like the oak tree My momma, she is as steady as the sun Oh you know I love my folks, but I keep starin' down the road Just lookin' for my one chance to runHey 'cause I will soar away like the blackbird I will blow in the wind like a seed I will plant my heart in the garden of my dreams And I will grow up where I want, wild and freeOh how do you wait for Heaven? And who has that much time? And how do you keep your feet on the ground? When you know that you were born, you were born, yeah You were born to flySo how do you wait for Heaven? And who has that much time? And how do you keep your feet on the ground? When you know that you were born, you were born to fly, yeah You were born to fly, fly, fly, fly, hey
