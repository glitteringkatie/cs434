I'll need time to get You off my mind And I may sometimes bother You Try to be in touch with You Even ask too much of You, from time to timeNow and then Lord, You know I'll need a friend And 'till I get used to losing You Let me keep on using You 'Til I can make it on my ownI'll get by, but no matter how I try There'll be times that You'll know I'll call Chances are my tears will fall And I'll have no pride at all, from time to timeBut they say, oh, there'll be a brighter day But 'til then I lean on You That's all I mean to do 'Til I can make it on my ownSurely someday I'll look up and see the morning sun Without another lonely night behind me Then I'll know I'm over You and all my cryin's done No more hurtin' memories can find meBut 'til then Lord, You know I'm gonna need a friend 'Til I get used to losing You Let me keep on using You 'Til I can make it on my own 'Til I can make it on my own
