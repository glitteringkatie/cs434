It was Labor Day weekend I was seventeen I bought a Coke and some gasoline And I drove out to the county fairWhen I saw her for the first time She was standing there in the ticket line And it all started right then and thereOh, a sailor's sky made a perfect sunset And that's the day I'll never forgetI had a barbecue stain on my white t shirt She was killing me in that miniskirt Skippin' rocks on the river by the railroad tracksShe had a suntan line and red lipstick I worked so hard for that first kiss And a heart don't forget something like thatWell, it was five years later on a southbound plane I was headed down to New Orleans To meet some friends of mine for Mardi GrasWhen I heard a voice from the past Comin' from a few rows back And when I looked, I couldn't believe just what I sawShe said, "I bet you don't remember me" And I said, "Only every other memory"I had a barbecue stain on my white t shirt You were killing me in that miniskirt Skippin' rocks on the river by the railroad tracksYou had a suntan line and red lipstick I worked so hard for that first kiss And a heart don't forget something like thatLike an old photograph Time can make a feeling fade But the memory of the first love Never fades awayI had a barbecue stain on my white t shirt She was killing me in that miniskirt Skippin rocks on the river by the railroad tracksShe had a sun tan line and red lipstick I worked so hard for that first kiss And a heart don't forget, no a heart don't forget I said, "A heart don't forget something like that"Oh, not something like that
