The face of an angel, pretty eyes that shine I lie awake at night wishing you were mine I'm standing here holding the biggest heartache in town Whenever you come aroundI get weak in the knees and I lose my breath Oh I try to speak but the words won't come I'm so scared to death And when you smile that smile, the world turns upside down Whenever you come aroundAnd I feel so helpless I feel just like a kid What is it about you that makes me keep my feelings hid I wish I could tell you, but the words can't be found Whenever you come aroundI get weak in the knees and I lose my breath Oh I try to speak but the words won't come I'm so scared to death And when you smile that smile, the world turns upside down Whenever you come aroundI get weak in the knees and I lose my breath Oh I try to speak but the words won't come I'm so scared to death And when you smile that smile, the world turns upside down Whenever you come aroundAnd when you smile that smile The whole world turns upside down Whenever you come around Whenever you come around
