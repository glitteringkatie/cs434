I travel both directions but leave one set of prints It's just a little trick, of the indigenous Developing inner visions of what religion isI caught the understanding and the underhanded I plan to build my ship and man it to another planet Under heavy surveillance, many different agents Some are camouflage, others are very blatantI study weapon systems and vocal fighting forms I'm many moves ahead, the thoughts are highly formed Like time times time times time is time squared Went there, sayin', "Rakaa you don't rhyme fair"But I never dummy lyrics and they kick it to my people It's about communication not a rappers ego Messages I sneak in they seem to seep in Mixed with alcohol and weed on the weekendShared among friends like various sins One day it clicks it's no longer dim Time release capsules humble the headstrong Your thoughts of takin' me head on are dead wrongI work the angles sharp and precise Dilated Peoples so you better build twice Act like ya know, not now but right now Dilated PeoplesEvidence, it's the master of Aikido I let go, karate confrontations Evidence scientist in innovation I locks on when I travels around planetsSmooth but got a rough edge like Wulitzer pianists Display mucho attack, receive payments for the cadence A in this, you get fit fowl with flagrance Free agents on the dotted line more hard to signNot easily impressed with gold mines and whole nines I'm somewhere in between never rushed and in a hurry And when I swing my bat I don't think I'll miss like baseball Fury the jury's hung, from verdict and got no chanceDilated comes first the rest are second like Stu Lance Oh yes it get better everyday The A 1, is my mind on vintage display?
