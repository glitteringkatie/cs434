Say, look at this, I've been cleaning out my nest And I found an old book of my poetryFresh out of school 'cause I was a high school grad Gots to get a job 'cuz I was a high school dad Wish I got paid by rappin' to the nation But that's not likely, so here's my applicationPass it to the man at AT&T; 'Cuz when I was in school, I got the A.E.E. But there's no S.E. for this youngsta I didn't have no money so now I gotta punch the clockGotta slave and be half a man The whitey says there's no room for the African Always knew that I would clock G's But welcome to McDonald's, may I take your order, please?Gotta serve ya food that might give you cancer 'Cuz my son doesn't take no for an answer Now I pay taxes that you never give me back What about diapers, bottles and Similac?Do I have to sell me a whole lotta crack For decent shelter and clothes on my back? Or should I just wait for help from Bush Or Jesse Jackson and Operation Push?If you ask me, the whole thing needs a douche A Massingill, what the hell crackers sell in the neighborhood? To the corner house bitches Miss Porker, Little Joe and Todd BridgesOr anybody that he know So I got me a bird better known as a kilo Now everybody know I went from po' To a nigga that got doughSo now you put the Feds against me 'Cause I couldn't follow the plan of the presidency I'm never givin' love again But blacks are too fuckin' broke to be republicanNow I remember, I used to be cool Till I stopped fillin' out my W 2 Now senators are gettin' hired And your plan against the ghetto backfiredSo now you got a pep talk But sorry, this is our only room to walk 'Cause we don't want a drug push But a bird in the hand is worth more than a BushTell the politicians, the hustlers Live and let live, yeah Tell the politicians, the hustlers Live and let live, yeah
