I grew up in the same places got shot in the face i saw abrahams brain split on the pave he jumped off the block right where the kids play chattin sh*t we all strayed i guess its deep seeded urban decay from my angle i can see ghetto burning away this kid 16 burning the yay mislearning the game i send a prayer for the painChorus As i stand here ooooooo watching the world go round how it always keeps me down is it supposed 2 be like this, like this? As we ride oooooooo to gain an edge in life someone always seems to try to come in the way, is it supposed to be like this?I come from a place where you cant tell whats around the corner goin to jail, or fail getting f**ked up like them little black kids from bronxtale well,as long as we're living in hell in the streets will always swell i can tell you a thourand tales documented and detailed and most n*iggas can relate around the world my nigga found with bullet rounds in his chest up in the atl and the papers hate me well im tryin to revoke the violence, not promote the violence this is my broken silence and you can hear my screams louder than police sirens im tynna fight back like my n*igga little byron just as long as i love and stay vibrant i shall provail and i shall not betrayal i shall put my hands up in the end and say i done wrong only time i tell, fo realChorus(Last verse coming from the heart) I guess we need more stability its like we're imprisoned in the ghetto and its getting to me to the point where im feelin institutionalised look in my eyes you'll see pain in it but who can decide? whether
